Most women treated for early-stage breast cancer undergo primary surgery .
This is often followed by adjuvant radiotherapy ( RT ) , which reduces breast cancer mortality after breast-conserving surgery and after mastectomy in those with node-positive disease ( 1 ) .
Long-term follow-up of these women has , however , revealed that some past regimens led to an increased risk of death from heart disease , particularly 10 years after RT , presumably because of some unwanted irradiation of the cardiac structures .
Dose - response curves for radiation-induced cardiac mortality have been produced using a radiobiologic model , called the relative seriality model , in conjunction with data on long-term cardiac mortality from two randomized trials of RT in which deaths from ischemic heart disease were reported in irradiated and unirradiated patients by breast cancer laterality ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .
These dose - response curves were , however , based on a few cardiac deaths and were , therefore , subject to considerable uncertainty .
They were used by Pierce et al. ( 4 ) to estimate normal tissue complication probabilities of cardiac mortality for seven postmastectomy RT techniques .
However , the investigators cautioned that until additional clinical data are available to validate predictive models , normal tissue complication probability estimates are best used for relative comparison between techniques rather than for absolute risk assessment .
The estimation of the cardiac risk of today 's breast RT requires the development of reliable dose - response relationships , which , in turn , require detailed cardiac dosimetry of past regimens given to women for whom we have long-term follow-up data .
At present , few heart dosimetry data from breast cancer RT are available .
Furthermore , it is unknown which quantitative measures of the heart dose or volume are most relevant to subsequent heart disease risk ( 2 ) .
Studies have used a variety of heart dose specifications , including the absorbed dose ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , biologically effective dose ( BED ) ( 7 ) , and the cumulative radiation effect ( an estimate of the biologic radiation dose  ) .
Published data recording the percentage volume of the heart irradiated to various doses are limited .
Such information might , however , be important in assessing radiation-related heart disease , because the percentage volume of the heart irradiated to a certain threshold dose might be a better predictor for cardiac death than , for instance , the mean heart dose or BED .
Information is also needed concerning the effect of irradiating different cardiac structures , especially the coronary arteries .
Coronary artery doses have been reported for several techniques , but only for left-sided irradiation ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ; however , most studies have reported only the mean dose to the whole heart .
In this study , a method was developed to estimate cardiac doses .
We present dose estimates for the whole heart and for the three main coronary arteries for techniques that were commonly used in the 1950s to the 1990s .
Information on heart disease rates from randomized trials of breast cancer RT ( 1 ) and observational studies ( 9 ) can be used in combination with these doses to derive dose - response relationships .
These should enable the prediction of the likely cardiac risk of current and future breast cancer RT regimens and facilitate the development of treatment guidelines .
In addition , for individual patients ( e.g. , those whose heart is included the radiation beam ) , it should allow the assessment of cardiac risk based on their RT plan , thus identifying women for whom complex planning techniques might be justified to reduce the cardiac dose .
Methods and Materials General method .
A technique based on virtual simulation and computed tomography ( CT ) -based three-dimensional treatment planning has been used to reconstruct RT regimens used in previous decades for treating the breast , chest wall , and / or locoregional lymph nodes .
Dose distributions were calculated using a treatment planning system ( Helax TMS , version 6.1B , Nucletron , Veenendaal , The Netherlands ) , which is accurate to within 2% for dose and 2 mm for position in most situations , as shown by phantom measurements ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) .
Approximately 40 consecutive CT planning scans of female patients , from the database of a U.K. RT department , were reviewed .
The patients were supine , with a T-bar arm rest , similar to positions used for breast cancer RT in previous decades .
From the 40 scans , one representative patient of average weight and height was chosen for the detailed calculations .
The CT data were transferred to a virtual simulation software package ( Exomio , release 2.0 , MedCom GmbH , Darmstadt , Germany ) .
The three-dimensional patient surface contours were defined by automated density gradient tracking .
The heart and coronary arteries were contoured by a radiation oncologist and reviewed by a radiologist .
The cranial limit of the heart included the right atrium and excluded the pulmonary trunk , ascending aorta , and superior vena cava .
The lowest contour of the heart was the caudal myocardial border .
The scans were not contrast enhanced .
Therefore , on some images , the coronary arteries were not visible , and their location was inferred using visible , reliable landmarks , including the anterior interventricular , left atrioventricular , and right atrioventricular grooves .
Because of the short length of the left main coronary artery , its contour was included with that of the left anterior descending ( LAD ) coronary artery .
Field borders , beam arrangements , and machine parameters for each RT regimen were defined using virtual simulation , with emphasis on the surface reconstruction function .
Figure 1 illustrates the use of virtual simulation to reconstruct a left internal mammary chain ( IMC ) field .

The treatment parameters and patient and organ-at-risk outlines were exported to the computerized treatment planning system , and dose distributions were calculated .
The algorithms used for the photon beams were the pencil beam model ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) and the collapsed cone superposition convolution algorithm ( 13 ) , ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) .
The former was used for all regimens and the latter for a selection of cases in which the tissue inhomogeneities were substantial .
Agreement between algorithms for the calculated heart doses was within 1% for most regimens and within 2% for all regimens .
For each regimen , cardiac dose - volume histograms were generated .
From these , estimates of the mean and maximum dose and percentage volume irradiated to different doses were obtained for the heart and for the LAD and right and circumflex coronary arteries .
The cardiac dose distributions for several 250-kV regimens and iridium wire implants were also derived .
This involved generating scaled hard copies of the appropriate CT slices on which isodose distributions for 250-kV X-rays or iridium wire implants were superimposed .
Manual planning techniques incorporating lung correction were used to generate cardiac dose distributions .
The physical density of lung was taken to be 0.25 g cm3 .
For the orthovoltage treatments , axial CT slices of the superior , middle , and inferior levels of the heart were used .
For single direct fields , an applied dose was assumed .
For tangential-pair RT , the use of tissue-equivalent bolus between the two applicators was assumed .
The proportion of each cardiac structure included within each isodose line was calculated and used to plot dose - volume histograms .
These were typically based on three CT slices per RT plan .
For the heart , approximately 150 dose points per CT slice were used , and for the three coronary arteries , their small volumes meant that only one dose point per slice was used .
For all regimens , BEDs were calculated using the linear quadratic model .
The estimated / ratios for radiation-related heart disease are 1 - 3 Gy ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) .
For these calculations , an / ratio of 2 Gy was used .
For orthovoltage RT , a correction factor of 1.1 was used to account for the enhanced biologic effectiveness of low-energy irradiation ( 7 ) .
The brachytherapy regimens reconstructed were typical of those used as a boost to the tumor bed after breast-conserving surgery and external beam RT .
The likely position of a surgical scar was marked using virtual simulation .
Mid-plane cross-sectional isodoses of a standard two-plane five-wire iridium implant were superimposed on scaled hard copies of three sagittal CT sections : one at the expected center of the implant , one 2 cm medial , and one 2 cm lateral to this point .
The iridium wires were 6 cm long and positioned 1.5 cm apart and 1.5 cm beneath the skin .
Specific techniques reconstructed .
The RT details for 60 trials of RT for early breast cancer ( 1950s - 1990s ) were collated using trial publications and protocols , textbooks ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) , and discussions with radiotherapists who had worked in various countries from 1950 onwards .
Using this information , RT techniques commonly used to treat the chest wall , breast , and associated lymphatics were reconstructed .
Descriptions of the target volumes , clinical definition of the field borders , field arrangements and beam energies are given in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. 2. The focus-to-skin distance was 100 cm for all fields ; wedges and compensators were not used .
The tangential pair beams were 180 opposed .

Variation in patient anatomy .
Two techniques were reconstructed on consecutive contemporary ( 2006 ) breast cancer patients on the CT planning database .
These patients were angled on a breast board , unlike the representative patient who was positioned flat .
This difference means there are small systematic differences in doses between these patients and the representative patient .
The interpatient variability , however , should be comparable .
Direct anterior left and right IMC fields and left tangential irradiation were reconstructed on 20 consecutive patients .
Right tangential irradiation was reconstructed on 5 consecutive patients , because little interpatient variation in heart dose was expected for this regimen .

Heart dose from chest wall or breast irradiation .
For breast or chest wall RT ( Figs. 2a - c ) , the mean heart dose varied between 0.9 and 14 Gy for left-sided and between 0.4 and 6 Gy for right-sided RT .
The largest doses resulted from orthovoltage ( 250-kV ) irradiation .
For example , for standard left tangential RT , the mean heart dose was 4.7 Gy for megavoltage and 14 Gy for orthovoltage irradiation .
This was partly explained by lateral scatter and partly by the depth - dose characteristics of an orthovoltage beam .
To deliver 42 Gy at the mid-plane point on the central axis , a given dose of approximately 42 Gy multiplied by 1.8 is needed from each tangential 250-kV beam .
The resulting dose distribution within the breast / chest wall and within normal tissue nearby is inhomogeneous , with hot spots of up to 125% of tumor dose ( 53 Gy ) within the heart for left-sided RT .
Where tangential beams were matched to a direct IMC field , the medial tangential border was 6 cm from the midline .
The heart was , therefore , several centimeters from the posterior field edges and received low radiation doses from the tangential beams .
The mean heart dose was 0.9 - 5 Gy for left-sided and 0.4 - 1 Gy for right-sided irradiation .
For wide tangential RT , the medial border was 1 cm contralateral to the midline .
Hence , relatively large heart volumes were irradiated : 10 Gy was received by 44.8 - 53% and 3.0 - 29% of the heart for left- and right-sided irradiation , respectively ( Appendix Tables 1 and 5 ) , and mean heart dose was 13.3 - 14 Gy and 2.3 - 9 Gy for left- and right-sided irradiation , respectively .
For irradiation of the left breast or chest wall , the part of the heart receiving the greatest doses was the anterior surface of the left ventricle .
The maximum heart dose was between 48.1 and 60 Gy for left tangential irradiation and 27.8 Gy for left electron irradiation .

View Within Article .
Heart dose from IMC irradiation .
The IMC is located anteriorly , in the intercostal spaces , close to the heart .
Therefore , IMC RT generally led to greater mean heart doses than irradiation of other targets , particularly for left-sided treatment .
IMC RT , using either direct anterior or wide tangential fields , delivered a mean heart dose of 2.7 - 16.7 Gy for left-sided and 2.3 - 10.5 Gy for right-sided RT , with the greatest doses resulting from left direct anterior 6-MV irradiation .
The heart volume irradiated was also considerable , particularly for direct anterior photon fields , which delivered 10 Gy to around 40% and around 20% of the heart for left- and right-sided fields , respectively .
In contrast , direct electron IMC irradiation resulted in a lower mean heart doses of around 2 Gy and lower heart volumes of around 7% receiving 10 Gy ( for both left- and right-sided RT ) , owing to the rapid decrease in dose beyond the 90% isodose .

Direct anterior megavoltage IMC RT resulted in irradiation of different parts of the heart for left- and right-sided treatment .
For a right-sided field , doses of 35 Gy were received by the right atrium , but , for a left-sided field , similar doses were received by the left ventricle .
Where direct anterior IMC and matched tangential irradiation were used together , most of the total heart dose originated from the IMC field .
For example , if 50 Gy was delivered to the chest wall and IMC using 6-MV beams , the IMC field would contribute 16.7 Gy and the chest wall fields , 0.9 Gy heart dose , giving a total mean heart dose of 17.6 Gy .
Heart dose from scar boost irradiation .
Mean heart dose from boost irradiation of the surgical scar was 1.0 Gy for both left- and right-sided RT .
Left-sided photon beams delivered 1 Gy mean heart dose whereas the left electron beam delivered only 0.3 Gy because of the rapid decrease in the depth dose .
Iridium wire implants were used in previous decades to deliver boost doses of 20 Gy to the scar ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) .
The localized deposition of dose from these implants meant that only a few percent of tumor dose ( 1 Gy ) was received by the heart for left-sided irradiation .
The heart dose from boost RT was small relative to the dose from the chest wall or breast RT because of the low given dose .
For example , a patient who received 50 Gy MV tangential left chest wall RT , followed by 10 Gy electron scar boost would receive a total mean heart dose of 5.0 Gy : 4.7 Gy from chest wall and 0.3 Gy from boost irradiation .
An important determinant of the heart dose from boost RT is the scar position relative to the heart , which is likely to vary from patient to patient .
The doses presented here illustrate the relative magnitude of the cardiac doses from different boost techniques and are useful for comparisons between techniques .
However , the doses can vary substantially between individual patients , depending on the boost position .
The magnitude of this uncertainty is assessed below in the section Variability in boost position .
Heart dose from supraclavicular fossa and axillary irradiation .
The supraclavicular fossa ( SCF ) and axillary fields were distant from the heart , which received scattered radiation alone .
The mean dose was 0.3 - 0.8 Gy for left-sided fields .
The right-sided SCF and axillary fields are even farther from the heart , therefore , the cardiac doses are likely to be lower .
Coronary artery doses .
The radiation dose received by each cardiac structure was mainly determined by its location relative to the treatment field ( s ) .
The LAD coronary artery on the anterior aspect of the heart is near the left breast and left IMC and , for all techniques used to treat these targets , the LAD dose exceeded the heart dose .
For example , left MV tangential irradiation delivered a mean heart dose of 5 Gy compared with a mean LAD dose of 20 Gy , and part of the LAD received 50 Gy ( Fig. 3 and Appendix Table 2 ) .
The LAD was in the penumbra of the left direct photon IMC field and received a mean dose of 20 Gy .
In contrast , for the right-sided field , it received a mean dose of 2 Gy from scattered radiation .
The right coronary artery is located anteriorly , to the right of midline .
For most techniques , it was excluded from the radiation field .
For direct anterior IMC irradiation , it was included in the right-sided IMC field , but not in the left .
The mean dose was 10.3 - 24 Gy for right-sided and 4.6 - 6.5 Gy for left-sided irradiation .
The circumflex coronary artery is located in the posterior myocardium and generally received lower doses than either the LAD or right coronary arteries .
The mean circumflex dose from tangential RT was 0.1 - 8 Gy .
Doses of 1 Gy were delivered by direct electron chest wall and scar boost irradiation .
Combinations of different regimens .
If a woman was treated with more than one regimen ( e.g. , direct IMC and matched tangential breast fields or tangential breast plus boost RT ) the mean doses from each regimen can be added to calculate the total mean dose to each cardiac structure .
For full dosimetric information , including the percentage volume of each structure irradiated to different doses or BED for combinations of different regimens , the described method can be used to reconstruct different regimens on the same dose plan .
Patient-to-patient variability in heart dose .
The doses in Tables 2 and Appendix Tables 1 - 8 are estimates for a representative patient of average weight and build .
The dose received by any individual patient will vary from these , depending on her individual characteristics , including breast size , extent of breast surgery , and sternal length , and on the circumstances of her RT ( e.g. , the linear accelerator used ) .
These sources of variability would , in most cases , apply to any method of estimating cardiac dose retrospectively .
The magnitude of their likely effect on cardiac dose is described below .
Variation in patient anatomy .
For tangential pair and direct IMC irradiation reconstructed on consecutive patients on the CT planning database , the mean heart dose varied from 1 to 2 Gy ( coefficient of variation [ mean divided by standard deviation ] [ CV ] , 11% ) for right-sided and from 2 to 4 Gy ( CV , 30% ) for left-sided tangential pair RT and from 5 to 15 Gy ( CV , 21% ) for right-sided and from 20 to 29 Gy ( CV , 11% ) for left-sided IMC RT .
Thus , for each regimen , there was some interpatient variability in heart dose , but there was also substantial variation between different regimens .

Presence of breast tissue .
All doses in Table 2 and Appendix Tables 1 - 8 are for a patient with breast tissue present .
Irradiation using a direct electron field was usually performed after mastectomy , and tangential pair and external beam scar boost irradiation were used after either mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery .
These techniques were reconstructed on the representative patient with breast tissue on the irradiated side , both included and excluded from the dose calculations .
The decrease in the mean heart dose caused by the presence of breast tissue was 1.5% and 0.7 Gy for all photon techniques ( tangential pair and scar boost irradiation ) .
For electron fields , the presence of breast tissue decreased the mean heart dose by 2.7 and 0.9 Gy for left and right electron chest wall fields , respectively , and by 0.2 and 0.06 Gy for left and right electron scar boost irradiation , respectively .
Variation in patient position .
Cardiac doses can be affected by patient treatment position .
Factors likely to affect cardiac doses are those that change either the thoracic ( and , therefore , cardiac ) position relative to the radiation beams ( e.g. , thorax angled on a breast-board or flat on the bed ) or those that influence the field borders .
For our representative patient , the thoracic position was similar to that used in previous decades for IMC , breast / chest wall , and SCF RT .
For axillary irradiation , some previous patients were treated prone , but this different position was unlikely to materially affect the heart dose because axillary RT usually delivered scattered cardiac irradiation alone .
For tangential irradiation , the ipsilateral arm position affects the field borders ( 29 ) .
Right breast / chest wall RT mostly involved only scattered cardiac dose .
For left tangential irradiation , the effect of a change in arm position was studied using a camera-based contouring system ( Osiris+ , Qados , Sandhurst , United Kingdom ) .
Left tangential , 6-MV RT was reconstructed on a volunteer first with both arms above her head , supported by a T-bar arm rest and , second , with her ipsilateral arm abducted to 90 and her contralateral arm by her side .
The heart dose was 2 Gy with the arms in the T-bar position and 3.4 Gy for the 90 arm position .
Difficulty identifying field borders .
Using the virtual simulator , precise identification of landmarks ( e.g. , sternal notch and xyphoid - sternal junction ) was subject to some uncertainty .
The effect of this on the mean heart dose was quantified by reconstructing tangential pair and direct IMC fieldsfirst , with the field ( s ) in the standard position , second , moved 1 cm superiorly , and third , moved 1 cm inferiorly .
Table 3 shows that the difference in mean heart dose that resulted from such movements was usually 10% and always 20% .

Variability in boost position .
Cobalt-60 and iridium wire boosts were reconstructed , first centered on the nipple , second moved 2 cm superiorly , and third , 2 cm inferiorly .
Table 4 shows the resulting differences in mean heart dose .
In reality , the position of the scar and , therefore , of the boost , could well vary more than 2 cm ; therefore , the heart dose measurements are subject to a high degree of uncertainty .
In general , the farther inferior the boost , the greater the heart dose .
However , the heart dose from boost irradiation is always low relative to other techniques because of the low given dose of 10 - 20 Gy .

Use of different models of treatment unit .
For axillary and SCF irradiation , two different makes of linear accelerator with , nominally , the same energy ( 6 MV ) were used .
These fields were chosen , because they are usually distant from the heart ; therefore , the heart dose is largely from scattered irradiation originating in the machine treatment head and can vary according to the machine used .
The mean heart dose varied between 0.8 - 1.4 Gy for supraclavicular and between 0.5 - 0.9 Gy for axillary fields .
Thus , the use of different RT machines made little difference to the heart dose .
To enable a comparison between different regimens , for each beam energy , the data from only one machine were used .
Effect of changing source-to-skin distance for cobalt-60 beams .
Direct IMC and tangential pair 60Co fields were set up using source-to-skin distances of 70 and 100 cm .
This difference in the source-to-skin distance resulted in differences in the mean heart dose of only 0.2 Gy for IMC and 0.1 Gy for tangential pair irradiation .
Discussion .
We have presented dose estimates for breast cancer RT regimens that were in widespread use worldwide from the 1950s to the 1990s .
There were considerable variations in the cardiac doses according to the regimen used .
For example , 6-MV direct IMC RT delivered 17-Gy heart dose and 25-Gy LAD dose , whereas electron IMC irradiation delivered 3-Gy heart dose and 6-Gy LAD dose , while still delivering therapeutic tumor dose .
Such differences are likely to have resulted in a wide variation in the cardiac doses worldwide , during the past few decades , owing to the diversity in RT practice .
This will be useful when deriving dose - response relationships .
Our estimates include coronary artery and heart doses for a wide variety of different regimens and are consistent with the few published CT-based estimates .
The techniques available for comparison were wide and standard left tangential irradiation ( 22 ) and ( 30 ) and direct IMC irradiation ( 2 ) and ( 24 ) .
The estimates of irradiated heart volumes were usually consistent with our estimates to within 3% of volume and were never more than 11% .

Full-size table .
Janjan et al. ( 5 ) calculated point cardiac doses rather than mean doses as in present study ; therefore , the results are not comparable and we omitted them from this comparison .
Also , Krueger et al. ( 6 ) reported heart and coronary artery doses from seven left-sided postmastectomy regimens that were mostly used around the year 2000 ; they all differed from the regimens reconstructed in this study , which were largely historical .
Reported doses estimated from published dose - volume histograms and converted from dose in equivalent 2-Gy fractions ; thus , a greater degree of uncertainty is present .

Sources of variability for a given regimen .
The reconstruction of any RT regimen is inevitably subject to several sources of variability .
This study has characterized the principal sources of dose variability for virtual simulation and CT planning of breast cancer RT .
The major source of error in estimating the cardiac doses for a given individual is likely to be variation in patient anatomy .
Individual dose plans and information on anatomy ( e.g. , patient outline ) were rarely available before the 1980s .
Therefore , when estimating cardiac doses for groups of patients treated in early trials of RT for breast cancer , the use of dose estimates for a representative patient , of average weight and build , might give the best indication of the cardiac doses received from particular regimens .
Some uncertainty existed in locating the three main coronary arteries because arterial contrast was not used for CT planning .
However , these arteries were visible on some CT slices , and their course tends to follow the interventricular and atrioventricular grooves , which are identifiable on CT .
In addition , the accuracy of CT-based estimates is limited by normal movement of the heart , lungs , and thoracic cage .
These movements will tend to slightly change the position of the heart relative to the radiation beams .
However , the CT planning scan used for these reconstructions was acquired during several minutes ( including many breathing cycles ) , and the original RT would also have been delivered during several minutes .
Therefore , the CT images are likely to illustrate the changing position of the heart relative to the treatment fields during the original RT , thus averaging the variation in dose caused by such changes .
For some regimens , heart dose is affected by patient position .
Treatment position for tangential irradiation in the 1950s to 1990s varied .
In some regions , the ipsilateral arm was elevated using a T-bar rest , in others it was abducted to 90. For left tangential RT , lowering the ipsilateral arm ( from the T-bar position to 90 ) changed the mean heart dose from 2 to 3.4 Gy in our volunteer , which represents a 70% increase .
Similar systematic changes in heart dose have been reported for 11 other patients ( 29 ) .
For our representative patient ( T-bar position ) , 6-MV left tangential irradiation delivered a 4.7 Gy mean heart dose .
If she had undergone irradiation in the 90 arm position , her heart dose might have been around 8 Gy ( assuming a 70% dose increase for a change from the T-bar to 90 arm position ) .
We speculate that the mean LAD dose could have been 70% greater , because it is close to the radiation beams .
The right and circumflex coronary arteries are distant from the tangential beams , and their doses were probably little affected by arm position .
Our dose estimates for left tangential irradiation are applicable to patients treated in the T-bar position but are likely to systematically underestimate the heart and LAD doses for patients irradiated with the ipsilateral arm lower ( e.g. , at 90 ) .
Irradiation of LAD coronary artery .
For most breast cancer RT regimens , the anterior part of the heart , including the LAD coronary artery , received the greatest radiation doses .
The LAD dose was generally greater than the dose to the whole heart or the two other coronary arteries .
The distribution of atherosclerosis in the general population is 40 - 50% LAD , 30 - 40% right coronary artery , and 15 - 20% circumflex coronary artery ( 31 ) .
Therefore , the greatest radiation doses were received by the coronary artery that appears to be most prone to atherosclerosis .
Blockage of the LAD by atherosclerosis can lead to left ventricular infarction .
Hence , radiation-induced damage to this artery might have contributed to the excess cardiac mortality seen after some past breast cancer RT regimens .
Coronary arterial damage after RT has been assessed directly using myocardial perfusion imaging , which assesses myocardial ischemia .
Several studies have shown an excess of anterior cardiac perfusion defects in areas of expected high dose between 6 months and 20 years after RT for left breast cancer ( 31 ) , ( 32 ) , ( 33 ) and ( 34 ) .
One study ( 35 ) revealed an increase in myocardial perfusion defects in the region supplied by the LAD 6 months after left tangential pair RT , but not in the regions supplied by the other coronary arteries .
It is unclear whether this damage leads to any clinical consequences or to the excess in death from heart disease seen after RT .
Need for dose - response relationship .
To reliably assess the cardiac risks of current and future RT regimens , relationships between the cardiac doses and subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality are needed .
This study has successfully quantified the cardiac doses and volumes irradiated for most common breast cancer RT regimens used between the 1950s and 1990s and demonstrated a wide range of cardiac doses .
These estimates were derived to enable the development of cardiac dose - response relationships using data from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group trials and data from other women for whom information on RT technique , tumor laterality , and outcome are available .
