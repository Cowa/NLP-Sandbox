Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia ( t-AML ) is a distinctive clinical syndrome occurring after exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy  .
The majority of t-AML result from the use of alkylating agents or DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors  .
Alkylating agent - related AML often occur after an average interval of 5 - 7 years , are proceded by myelodysplastic syndromes , are frequently described as M1 or M2 , and are associated with abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7. Alternatively , t-AML resulting from DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors treatment appear frequently as M4 or M5 after a shorter interval and are associated with translocation of chromosomes 11 ( 11q23 ) and 21 ( 21q22 )  .
Less often are associated with inv ( 16 ) , t ( 8;16 ) , and t ( 15;17 )  .
Chromosomal translocations t ( 11;19 ) ( q23;p13 ) that result in MLL gene rearrangements are often associated with the diagnosis of t-AML after treatment with a topoisomerase II inhibitor .
The survival of these patients is generally poor  .
The 12p13 region is genetically unstable and fragile , with subsequent translocations and insertions into other chromosomes  .
It has been reported that multiple chromosome breaks in this region were likely to be induced through chemo / radiotherapy or mutagens , and are associated with a subgroup of patients with an extremely bad prognoses  .
The ETV6 ( previously TEL ) gene at 12p13 , a transcription factor of the E-26 transforming specific family that is essential for establishing definitive hematopoiesis in the bone marrow , has been found to be rearranged in some of these cases  .
Several of these rearrangements resulted in a fusion of the ETV6 gene with more than 20 different partners , including ABL , MDS1 , CBFB , MN1 , JAK2 , STL , and PDGFRB  .
It has also been reported that in cells harboring translocations with the ETV6 gene , the nonrearranged ETV6 allele is often deleted or inactivated .
The clinical consequence of ETV6 loss of function in AML , however , has not been defined yet  .
Although the 12p13 region is genetically unstable , with subsequent translocations into other chromosomes , t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q12q13 ) is a rare cytogenetic abnormality reported in only seven leukemia cases .
To the best of our knowledge , the t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q12q13 ) has never been detected in treatment-induced acute leukemias  .
Thus , the data regarding the clinical course and outcome of these patients are limited .
We report here on a case of t-AML after breast cancer chemo / radiotherapy with a rare reciprocal t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q13 ) as a secondary cytogenetic abnormality in addition to the t ( 11;19 ) ( q23;p13.1 ) , in which the translocated ETV6 gene was found to be disrupted .
2. Case report .
In June 2001 , a 42-year-old woman was diagnosed with left breast cancer and she underwent wide local excision with sentinel lymph node dissection .
She received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of two cycles of epirubicin and taxole and four cycles of 5 fluorouracil , epirubicin , and cyclophosphamide , as well as local radiation therapy ( total dose 47Gy ) .
Hormonal maintenance treatment with tamoxifene was followed .
Four years later , on December 27 , 2005 , she was admitted for investigation of pancytopenia .
A full peripheral blood cell count showed a white blood cell ( WBC ) count of 1.06 109 / L with 16% neutrophils , 70% lymphocytes , and 2% monocytes , platelets 40 109 / L , hemoglobin 8.8gr / dL , hematocrit 27% , mean corpuscular volume 100 fL , and mean corpuscular hemoglobin 33 pg .
A routine biochemistry screen revealed an elevated lactate dehydrogenase of 551 IU ( normal range 460 IU ) .
Clinically , the absence of both hepatosplenomegaly and palpable lymph nodes was noted .
A bone marrow aspirate showed an infiltration of medium- to large-sized blasts that consisted 35% of all nucleated cells and had a morphology suggestive of a myeloid origin , as well as trilineage dysplasia that was present in less than 50% of the cells in all three lines .
Immunophenotypic analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated positivity of CD13 , CD33 , CD34 , CD117 , MPO , and HLA-DR , consistent with acute myeloid leukaemia M2 ( AML-M2 ) .
Chromosome analysis of bone marrow cells showed 46,XX,t ( 11;19 ) ( q23;p13.1 )  /46,XX  .
Induction chemotherapy with cytarabine , idarubicin , and cytarabine was administered , and a complete remission was achieved .
The patient underwent three courses of consolidation therapy .
The first course consisted of cytarabine and idarubicin , the second course consisted of cytarabine and etoposide , and the third course consisted of cytarabine .
Eight months later , in October 2006 , she relapsed with the same morphologic and immunophenotypic findings .
A new cytogenetic analysis showed 46,XX,t ( 11;19 ) ( q23;p13.1 )  /46,idem,t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q13 )  .
Salvage chemotherapy consisting of mitoxandrone , etoposide , and cytarabine was administered .
Thirty-two days later , peripheral blood cell count showed WBC 2.8 109 / L with 45% neutrophils , 50% lymphocytes , 3% monocytes , and 2% eosinophils .
A new bone marrow aspirate was consistent with morphologic remission ( blasts 5% ) and marked trilineage dysplasia .
Due to the fact that it has been impossible to identify a suitable donor in the international donor pool , a haploidentical allogeneic bone marrow transplant from the patient 's sister had been scheduled .
Unfortunately , bone marrow transplantation was postponed because the patient has been in continuous relapse for the last 4 months .
3. Materials and methods3.1 .
Chromosome studies .
Chromosome studies were performed on unstimulated bone marrow cells that had been cultured for 24 and 48 hours .
Cytogenetic analyses were performed on trypsin G - banded chromosome preparations , and imaging and karyotyping were performed with microscopy and computer imaging techniques in at least 20 metaphase cells each time .
Karyotypes were described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature ( ISCN ) 2005 .
3.2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH )
FISH studies were performed on bone marrow cytogenetic specimens .
The following specific DNA probes were used : LSI MLL dual-color break-apart rearrangement probe , LSI TEL / AML1 ES dual-color translocation probe , LSI ETV6 ( TEL ) ( 12p13 ) dual-color break-apart rearrangement probe , LSI CHOP ( 12q13 ) dual-color break-apart rearrangement probe ( Abbott Molecular / Vysis , Des Plains , IL ) , and chromosome 1/5 / 19 -satellite probe ( Cytocell , Cambridge , UK ) .
Dual-color FISH images were digitally generated using Isis FISH imaging software ( MetaSystems , Altlussheim , Germany ) .
4. Results4.1 .
Cytogenetic results .
Chromosomal analyses of bone marrow cells at diagnosis showed an abnormal clone containing a reciprocal translocation between the long arm of chromosome 11 and the short arm of chromosome 19 with breakpoints at q23 and p13.3 , respectively , in 10 / 23 metaphase cells evaluated .
The karyotype was thus described as 46,XX,t ( 11;19 ) ( q23;p13.1 )  /46,XX  .
While the patient was in relapse , new cytogenetic analyses of the bone marrow revealed two abnormal clones .
The first clone was the one detected at diagnosis in 5 / 20 metaphases evaluated .
The evolutionary clone carried an additional reciprocal translocation between the short arm of chromosome 12 and the long arm of the other homologue 12 with breakpoints at p13 and q13 , respectively , detected in 15 / 20 metaphase cells evaluated .
The karyotype was described as 46,XX,t ( 11;19 ) ( q23;p13.1 )  /46,idem,t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q13 )  .

4.2. FISH .
The MLL probe showed a split signal in 83.7% of 200 interphase nuclei analyzed , while metaphase FISH analysis revealed that the 3 primer of one MLL gene was translocated to the der ( 19 ) , confirming the reciprocal exchange between chromosomes 11q and 19p .
The TEL / AML1 probe for the ETV6 / RUNX1 genes showed a normal pattern of hybridization in 200 interphase nuclei , but metaphase analysis detected both signals corresponding to the two alleles of the ETV6 gene , each normally located at 12p13 , on the short derivative chromosome 12 .
To investigate whether the ETV6 gene was translocated intact to the other der ( 12 ) , the LSI ETV6 ( TEL ) ( 12p13 ) dual-color break-apart rearrangement probe was used and a split hybridization signal was detected in both interphase and metaphases cells .
Interphase FISH analyses detected 53% of the 200 nuclei scored with the split signal .
In metaphase cells , the 5 primer of one ETV6 gene was found on the small der ( 12 ) t ( 12;12 ) while the 3 primer remained on the large der ( 12 ) t ( 12;12 ) .
The probe specific for the CHOP gene showed a normal hybridization pattern in 200 interphase nuclei analyzed , while both CHOP alleles were found on the large der ( 12 ) by interphase FISH .

5. Discussion .
Our case is a treatment-induced AML-M2 that was diagnosed 4 years after intensive chemo / radiotherapy for breast cancer .
The reciprocal t ( 11;19 ) ( q23;p13.1 ) , detected at diagnosis by cytogenetic analyses and further characterized by FISH analyses , was the primary chromosomal abnormality .
The t ( 11;19 ) ( q23;p13.1 ) is often associated with the diagnosis of t-AML , mainly with M4 or M5 , and at times with M1 and M2  .
The present AML-M2 case seems to result from topoisomerase II inhibitor agents , epipodophyllotoxins , or anthracyclines rather than from alkylating agents because it was not preceded by a preleukemic phase ( MDS ) , showed balanced translocations involving chromosome band 11q23 , and presented at a rather short interval after chemotherapy  .
Moreover , younger age as our patients age and not a specific type of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor seems to predispose specifically to development of t-AML with translocations to chromosome band 11q23  .
The evolutionary clone , which was detected upon disease relapse 8 months after consolidation therapy , was characterized additionally by t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q13 ) .
Thus , t ( 12;12 ) was a secondary cytogenetic change that caused growth advantage to the evolutionary clone .
Since secondary abnormalities are closely associated with the progression of leukemia  and t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q13 ) was detected upon disease relapse , it is likely that t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q13 ) played an important role in the progression of leukemia .
A review of the literature revealed that t ( 12;12 ) ( p12-13;q13 ) has been reported in only seven leukemia cases with limited clinical data .
These cases include two cases of ALL , one case of CML , three cases of AML , and one case of MDS ( RARB-1 ) that progressed rapidly to AML  .
Although acute leukemia cases with 12p13 rearrangement have been reported in patients with a history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy , such as our patient , and are associated with an unfavorable prognosis  , none of the reported cases with t ( 12;12 ) ( p12p13;q13 ) and available medical history appear to be therapy related .
Like our patient , however , all the reported patients with AML and t ( 12;12 ) ( p12p13;q13 ) had a bad outcome or an unfavourable prognosis , except one whose outcome was not available .
Since in most of the reported cases the treatment of the patients was not available and t ( 12;12 ) was not the only cytogenetic aberration , the prognosis of t ( 12;12 ) as the sole aberration is currently unknown .
Our patient has been in continuous relapse for the last 4 months , and has a very poor prognosis not only because of t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q13 ) , but also because of the t ( 11;19 ) ( q23;p13.1 ) associated with the diagnosis of t-AML .

In the current case , the t ( 12;12 ) resulted in a split of ETV6 gene demonstrating that the breakpoint on the large der ( 12 ) t ( 12;12 ) is located within the ETV6 gene .
Thus , the ETV6 gene was disrupted , making the expression of the wild-type product improbable , indicating the possible formation of a new fusion gene .
As it is known , a fusion gene may lead to the formation of a chimeric protein , activation of the partner gene , or in few cases to the formation of unproductive ETV6 protein .
Rearrangements of the ETV6 gene has been detected in another AML-M2 case with t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q13 ) at the relapse of the disease , as in our case  .
Panagopoulos et al. reported a fusion of ETV6 and BAZ2A at 12q13 generated through a cryptic rearrangement between 12p13 and 12q13 , which was not expected to produce a chimeric protein , but a truncated form of ETV6 , in a pediatric pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia  .
Further characterization of 12p rearrangements is important because not only may it reveal a new fusion gene , increasing our understanding of its functional properties , but may also identify new breakpoints that may disclose previously unrecognized oncogenes .
The translocation of the CHOP gene ( at 12q13 ) to the large der ( 12 ) , indicated that the breakpoint on the small der ( 12 ) was proximal to CHOP .
The fact that it was translocated intact revealed that the CHOP gene was not fused with ETV6 .
However , it was not determined , however , whether the change of the position of the CHOP gene affected its normal expression .
Balanced translocations of the long arm of chromosome 12 have been described in myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia , implicating the 12q13q24 region in the pathogenesis of this malignant myeloproliferative disease  .
Since approximately 10% of myelofibrosis and other Ph-negative myeloproliferative diseases transform to acute leukemia , genes on the 12q region may play an important role in predisposition to AML .
Our investigation emphasizes the role of split-signal FISH for detection of submicroscopic chromosome reararrangements in leukemias , especially for target genes with multiple partner genes such as ETV6 and MLL genes .
The split-signal FISH approach can detect a deletion of one part of the gene , or a translocation , independently of the involved partner gene .
Moreover , it allows the identification of the partner gene or partner chromosome region if metaphases are present and there are no high levels of false positivity ranging between 5 and 10%  .
In conclusion , our findings suggest that the ETV6 gene rearrangements in t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q13 ) may reveal a new fusion gene involving ETV6 and a new partner gene at band 12q12q13 , and that the disruption of this gene may be involved in the progression of the disease .
To the best of our knowledge , this case also represents the first report of the rare t ( 12;12 ) ( p13;q13 ) associated with t-AML and emphasizes the role of split-signal FISH for detection of submicroscopic chromosome rearearrangements in leukemias .
