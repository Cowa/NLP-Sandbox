Two-third of patients with recurrent breast cancer present initially with distant metastases ( DM ) which is the most frequent cause of breast cancer-specific mortality .
Figure 1 shows sites of first breast cancer relapse.1 The most common metastatic site is bone,  and approximately 40,000 women with breast cancer die from bone metastases each year.4 .

Survival following recurrence is significantly longer for patients with a locoregional recurrence ( median time : 6.4 years ) versus patients who developed DM ( median time : 3.4 years ) .  The site of distant metastasis affects the prognosis .
Patients with bone as the first site of metastasis had better overall survival ( OS ) ( 71 months versus 48 months ; P 0.001 ) and survival after first metastases ( 24 months versus 12 months ; P 0.001 ) than did patients with visceral metastases.7 Five-year OS rates are 16% , 12% , and 0% for patients with bone , lung , or liver metastases , respectively.6 .
Because about 66% of breast cancers express hormonal receptors and are potentially endocrine-responsive,8 endocrine therapy is essential in the management of breast cancer patients .
Adjuvant endocrine therapy trials of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors ( AIs ) reported efficacy in terms of disease-free survival ( DFS ) and distant DFS ( DDFS ) .
Therapies able to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence , especially those that reduce DM , are likely to have the most significant beneficial effect on increasing survival time in patients diagnosed with early breast cancer .
This review will discuss the timing and risk factors for DM and the efficacy of the current third-generation AIs in reducing the risk of DM in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer .
Timing of recurrence .
The peak hazard period for recurrence is observed during the first 2 years after surgery , but the risk is ongoing .
Even 12 years after the diagnosis , it is not zero ; the rate of recurrence is 4.7% at years 5 - 8 , 3.4% at years 8 - 12 , and 4.3% at years 5 - 12.9 .
A different timing of recurrence has been observed in hormonal receptor positive and negative breast cancer patients.10 In hormone receptor-negative disease , the risk for breast cancer relapse is higher during the first 5 years , with a peak between the first and the third year after surgery ; after the fifth year , the risk decreases dramatically .
In hormone receptor-positive disease , the peak of relapse between the first and third year is lower than that observed in hormone receptor-negative tumors , and after the fifth year , the risk remains high , especially in node-positive disease.9 In postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive patients treated with endocrine therapy , early recurrences occur more frequently in the presence of one or more of the following tumor-related factors : large tumor size ( 2 cm ) , high number of involved axillary lymph nodes , poor histological grade , low level of estrogen receptor , and human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2 overexpression.  Early relapse rate ranges from 3.7%11 to 7.4%,12 and the majority of them are DM.13 .
Type of breast cancer recurrence : predicting factors and overall survival .
The site of first DM remains poorly predictable , although a more frequent association has been observed between hormonal receptor negativity and the development of visceral metastases and between lobular histology and the development of serosal surface metastases.1 Recent data indicate that HER2 overexpressing breast cancer patients are at increased risk for brain metastases.14 In the future , gene expression profiling may better predict the site of breast cancer metastases.15 .
After breast-conserving surgery , young age ( 35 years ) , vascular invasion , and extensive in situ carcinoma are associated with a high risk of local recurrence , while after mastectomy , only the vascular invasion retains an independent role in predicting local recurrence.16 A local recurrence is associated with a high risk of developing DM .
Patients who developed a local recurrence have a threefold increased risk of DM , as compared to patients without local recurrence. 
Irrespective of type , recurrence is associated with increased mortality in patients with early breast cancer , but the effect on mortality is greater in patients with distant recurrence.5 A recent retrospective cohort study of 1616 patients with early ( stages I - II ) breast cancer found the 5 year OS for patients with no recurrence to be 91.7% , versus 41.3% and 59.3% for patients with DM and locoregional recurrence , respectively.5 Compared with the non-recurrence group , the hazard ratio ( HR ) for death ( any cause ) was highest for patients with a distant recurrence ( HR = 13.6 ; P 0.001 ) , followed by locoregional recurrence ( HR = 4.5 ; P 0.001 ) and the contralateral recurrence groups ( HR = 3.0 ; P = 0.01 ) , with similar trends observed for breast cancer-specific death ( HR distant versus locoregional = 3.6 ; P 0.001 ) .5 Another smaller study of 105 patients found DM to be the most frequent type of recurrence ( eight isolated local recurrences , 33 DM , and 16 local recurrences with DM ) and was associated with the lowest 5- and 10 year survival rates .9 Median survival times after an isolated local first recurrence and a distant metastatic first event were 12.9 and 2.2 years , respectively.19 .

The impact of adjuvant endocrine therapy on distant metastases Tamoxifen .
The meta-analysis of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group showed that , at a median follow-up of 15 years , 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy significantly reduced recurrence by 41% and mortality by 34% in patients with estrogen receptor-positive ( ER+ ) tumors .
Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy reduced the risk of local recurrence by 53% ( HR = 0.47 ; P 0.00001 ) and the risk of DM by 36% ( HR = 0.64 ; P 0.00001 ) .10 The introduction of aromatase inhibitors in the adjuvant therapy do improve such results leading to the recommendation that optimal hormonal therapy for a post-menopausal woman should include an aromatase inhibitor as initial therapy or after treatment with tamoxifen.20 Five years of tamoxifen could be again an available option for some subgroups of postmenopausal patients , such as patients with major contraindications to aromatase inhibitors or patients who do not tolerate aromatase inhibitors .
Aromatase inhibitors .
In the adjuvant setting , AIs have been evaluated by using three different strategies : initial therapy for 5 years after the diagnosis ( upfront strategy ) ; switch therapy , with the switch to the AI after 2 - 3 years of tamoxifen ( switch strategy ) ; and extended therapy , with the use of the AI after 5 years of tamoxifen ( extended adjuvant strategy ) .
All studies evaluating the role of AIs as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal early breast cancer patients reported the impact of these drugs in terms of distant metastases with varying degrees .
However , some differences in defining DM as the study end point exist between trials .
Time to distant metastases was defined as time from random assignment to distant recurrence , ignoring local , regional , contralateral breast recurrence and second ( non-breast ) malignancies and censoring deaths without recurrence in an upfront study with letrozole,  in studies using a switch strategy with tamoxifen followed by anastrozole,23 and in a study of extended therapy with letrozole after 5 years of tamoxifen.24 In the switch strategy with exemestane ( Intergroup Exemestane Study [ IES ] ) ,25 events considered in time to distant recurrence included not only distant recurrence but also deaths from breast cancer and deaths with unknown cause with no metastases reported .
The type of event considered for calculating time to distant metastases was not reported in the upfront study with anastrozole.26 The impact of these drugs on time to distant metastases in the various trials is reported in Table 2. .

Upfront strategy with anastrozole .
Initial results of the arimidex , tamoxifen alone or in combination trial reported significantly improved DFS in patients receiving anastrozole ( n = 3125 ) compared with those receiving tamoxifen ( n = 3166 ) .26 At 68 month follow-up , 324 total distant metastases occurred in the anastrozole arm and 375 occurred in the tamoxifen arm .
There was a significant prolongation in the time to DM ( 14% ; P = 0.04 ) 27 in the overall population .
In the subset of hormone receptor-positive patients , there was a significant risk reduction of 17% in DFS ( HR = 0.83 ; P = 0.005 ) and a trend toward reduction in the incidence of DM ( HR = 0.84 ; 95% CI : 0.70 - 1.00 ; P = 0.06 ) .27 There was no significant benefit in survival in the overall population ( HR = 0.97 ; P = 0.7 ) , and the 12% reduction in deaths from breast cancer in the anastrozole group was also not significant ( HR = 0.88 ; P = 0.2 ) .
Upfront strategy with letrozole .
The Breast International Group ( BIG ) 1 - 98 trial is examining the effect of tamoxifen or adjuvant letrozole monotherapy ( trial arms A and B , respectively ) , as well as sequential adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen ( 2 years ) followed by letrozole ( arm C ) or letrozole ( 2 years ) followed by tamoxifen ( arm D ) for a total of 5 years , in 8028 postmenopausal women with breast cancer.22 At a median follow-up of 25.8 months , the primary core analysis included patients from the monotherapy arms and the sequential arms .
A total of 779 DFS events had occurred .
Patients receiving letrozole demonstrated a 19% improvement in DFS ( P = 0.003 ) and a 27% reduction ( P = 0.0012 ) in the risk of DM , compared with patients in the tamoxifen arm.22 .
Another analysis of BIG 1 - 98 , at 2 years median follow-up , reported that DM were the most common type of early recurrence , occurring in 201 of 216 events ( 93% ) , and initial adjuvant letrozole therapy markedly reduced the risk of early DM ( 87 DM events with letrozole versus 125 DM events with tamoxifen ; 30% reduction ) ( 11 ) .
Updated results from BIG 1 - 98 , obtained at a median of 51 months and considering the monotherapy arms only ( n = 2463 letrozole ; n = 2459 tamoxifen ) , continue to demonstrate the superiority of letrozole over tamoxifen in DFS as well as in reduction in the risk of DM ( HR = 0.81 ; 95% CI : 067 - 098 ; P = 0.03 ) 22 .
Switch aromatase inhibitor therapy .
Trials which evaluated the switch strategy , can be further subdivide in trials using an unplanned switch and trials using a planned switch .
In the former trials ( IES,25 ITA28 and ARNO29 studies ) only patients who had no recurrence after 2 - 3 years of tamoxifen were randomized to continue tamoxifen or to switch to AI , whist in the trials using the planned switch ( ABCSG830 and BIG 1 - 9821 ) patients were randomized to either 5 years of tamoxifen or tamoxifen followed by AI at diagnosis .
As a consequence , patients with early recurrence on tamoxifen would be counted as failures in the planned switch trials but would no enter the unplanned switch trails , thus potentially biasing these former trials to more favorable results .
Final data from ABCSG8 and BIG 1 - 98 will indicate if results from planned switch trails will be different from those of planned switch ones .
Among studies using planned or unplanned switch , data from anastrozole and exemestane  are available , but data for letrozole ( sequential arms of BIG 1 - 98 ) are expected in 2008 .
Anastrozole .
Pooled results of the three available trials,  in which anastrozole has been used as planned or unplanned switch therapy after 2 - 3 years of tamoxifen , has been reported in a recently published meta-analysis.23 Patients who switched to anastrozole had significant improvements in distant recurrence-free survival ( HR = 0.61 ; 95% CI : 0.45 - 0.83 ; P = 0.002 ) and OS ( HR = 0.71 ; 95% CI : 0.52 - 0.98 ; P = 0.04 ) .
Because trials included in this meta-analysis were variable in their design and inclusion criteria ( two unplanned switch , ITA and ARNO studies , and one planned switch trial , ABCSG-8 study ) results are possibly unreliable and must be interpreted cautiously .
Exemestane .
The IES study , which can be classified as unplanned switch trial , examined the efficacy and safety of switching to exemestane ( n = 2362 ) following 2 - 3 years of tamoxifen adjuvant therapy for a total of 5 years or continuing tamoxifen ( n = 2380 ) for 5 years.31 The most recent analysis of the IES , conducted at 55.7 months of follow-up , demonstrates an improvement in DFS ( unadjusted HR = 0.76 ; P = 0.0001 ) and time to distant recurrence ( HR = 0.83 ; P = 0.03 ) in the overall patient population .
Similarly , improvements in DFS ( unadjusted HR = 0.75 ; P = 0.0001 ) , time to distant recurrence ( HR = 0.83 ; P = 0.03 ) , and OS ( unadjusted HR = 0.83 ; P = 0.05 ) were observed in the ER+ patient population.25 .
Extended adjuvant therapy .
More than half of breast cancer recurrences and deaths occur after 5 years of tamoxifen therapy.10 The majority of these delayed recurrences are distant metastatic events , emphasizing that there is still a need to reduce the long-term risk of DM. 
A potential strategy to reduce the risk of delayed recurrence is the extension of endocrine therapy beyond 5 years .
Various trials compared about 10 versus 5 years of tamoxifen and were cumulatively analyzed by the EBCTCG overview.10 Although longer treatment with tamoxifen appears to involve slightly lower recurrence and breast cancer mortality rates , the findings are not reliably informative because of the low number of events .
On the other hand , non-breast-cancer mortality appears to be greater among patients allocated longer treatment .
Although this difference is not clearly significant ( 1.2 versus 0.9% / year , death rate ratio 1.31 [ SE 0.16 ] , 2p = 0.06 ) , clinicians prefer not to recommend tamoxifen beyond 5 years , at least until a statistically reliable evidence emerges both for recurrence and , particularly , for mortality from trials of 10 versus 5 years of tamoxifen .
Extended adjuvant therapy with AIs now offers women further protection against delayed relapses .
Anastrozole .
The small , open-label Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group trial 6a evaluated the efficacy of extended adjuvant anastrozole ( n = 387 ) compared with no treatment ( n = 469 ) in postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer .
At 60 months of follow-up , overall disease recurrence was reduced with anastrozole ( HR = 0.64 ; P = 0.0477 ) .33 Additional efficacy results showed distant metastatic recurrences in 4% of patients receiving anastrozole ( 16 / 387 ) and in 7.5% of those receiving no treatment ( 35 / 469 ) .33 These preliminary results may suggest a beneficial effect of anastrozole in the extended adjuvant setting ; however , no safety data have been reported or published to date .
Letrozole .
The impact of extended adjuvant letrozole therapy on DM has been evaluated in the phase III double-blind randomized MA.17 trial comparing letrozole versus placebo after 5 years of tamoxifen ( N = 5187 ) .34 After a median follow-up of 30 months ( 2.5 years ) , the letrozole arm demonstrated a significant 40% reduction ( HR = 0.60 ; 95% CI : 0.43 - 0.84 ; P = 0.002 ) in the risk of distant breast cancer recurrences.24 Subgroup analysis also demonstrated the superiority of letrozole in several prespecified subgroups , including node-negative and node-positive patients , and those with and without prior chemotherapy .
Four-year DFS was 94.4% in the letrozole arm and 89.8% in the placebo arm ( P 0.001 ) .24 .
No difference between the arms has been observed for overall survival in MA.17 ( 95.4% versus 95.0% , respectively ; P = 0.3 ) ; however , a survival advantage is apparent in women with node-positive breast cancer .
In this group , which comprised approximately 50% of all patients in MA.17 , the risk of death was reduced by a significant 39% compared with placebo ( HR = 0.61 ; P = 0.04 ) .24 .
Exemestane .
The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-33 trial has examined the use of exemestane versus placebo as extended adjuvant therapy in patients treated with tamoxifen for 5 years .
The trial was blinded prematurely as a result of the reporting of the MA.17 trial results , and full accrual was not reached.35 Despite the subsequent crossover of about 44% of the placebo patients receiving exemestane in the trial , at a median follow-up of 30 months , exemestane-treated patients had a statistically significant improvement in relapse-free survival ( 96% versus 94% ; relative risk = 0.50 ; P = 0.03 ) , but there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of distant metastases ( 11 events in the exemestane group versus 16 events in the placebo group ; P = 0.3 ) or in OS ( 13 deaths in the placebo group versus 16 in the exemestane group ; relative risk = 1.2 ; P = 0.63 ) .35 .
Which AI treatment strategy is most effective at reducing the risk of distant metastases ?
In patients with a new diagnosis of breast cancer , direct comparison between upfront and switch strategies is ongoing in two randomized trials , BIG 1 - 98 and the Tamoxifen , Exemestane , Adjuvant Multicenter study .
Waiting for the results of such studies , oncologists face the problem of choosing between these two strategies .
Available data  suggest that some tumor-related factors may help identify patient at high risk of early relapse , ie , within the first 2 - 2.5 years after the diagnosis .
Such factors include those that can predict de novo resistance to tamoxifen , e.g. , HER2 overexpression and low level of ER , and those associated with highly aggressive tumors , such as large tumor size ( 2 cm ) , high number ( 4 ) of metastatic lymph nodes , poor histological grading , and vascular invasion .
The majority of early relapses are distant metastases .
Data from the BIG 1 - 98 trial showed that local and distant recurrences were 0.6% and 3.3% , respectively , in tamoxifen-treated patients and 0.3% and 2.3% , respectively , in letrozole-treated patients.11 Because treatment with letrozole is more effective than tamoxifen in reducing early recurrence,11 patients at high risk of such recurrences should receive upfront therapy with AIs .
For patients without risk factors for early relapse , the best strategyie , upfront or switch therapyremains unknown .
Waiting for the results of trials directly comparing the two strategies in terms of both efficacy and tolerability , the different toxicity profile of tamoxifen and AI36 may help clinicians in choosing between the two strategies , in individual patients .
In newly diagnosed patients , a potential strategy could be a planned extended therapy , i.e. a prospective policy of 5 years of tamoxifen followed by additional 5 years of AI .
However , the high recurrence rate of nearly 13 - 15%  in the first 5 years of tamoxifen could be not counterbalanced by the expected absolute benefit of 5% observed with the extended therapy .
Because the early ( during the first 5 years , by up-front or planned switch strategy ) introduction of AI has been already demonstrated able to reduce the recurrence rate in the first 5 years of 3 - 5% , it is preferable to the delayed introduction of AI in newly diagnosed patients .
Which AI is most effective at reducing the risk of distant metastases ?
There are as yet no directly comparative data for the AIs regarding their efficacy at reducing DM .
Results of a randomized crossover study in 54 postmenopausal women showed that 12 week treatment with letrozole was significantly more effective than anastrozole in reducing median estradiol levels ( P 0.0001 ) .37 Similarly , in a double-blind , crossover comparison , the inhibition of aromatization was significantly greater with letrozole than with anastrozole.38 In this cross-over study patients were treated with anastrozole followed by letrozole or vice versa .
The mean percentage of inhibition of aromatase levels was 97.3% during treatment with anastrozole and 99.1% , during letrozole treatment .
Treatment with anastrozole suppressed plasma levels of estrone , estradiol and estrone sulfate by a mean of 81.0% , 84.9% and 93.5% respectively , whereas treatment with letrozole caused a corresponding decrease of 84.3% , 87.8% and 98.0% , respectively .
The suppression of estrone and estrone sulfate was significantly better during treatment with letrozole compared with anastrozole ( p = 0.019 and 0.0037 , respectively ) Whether these differences in potency are clinically relevant is not known .
In one directly comparative open-label study of letrozole versus anastrozole on 713 patients for the second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer , letrozole appeared to be more effective than anastrozole in terms of response rate ( 19.1% versus 12.3% , p = 0.013 ) , but there was not significant difference in time to progression , which was the primary end point of this study ( TTP = 5.7 months for both treatments ) .39 Ongoing trials comparing the different types of AIs in the adjuvant setting will clarify the issue of the best AI .
Conclusions .
Timing of breast cancer recurrences is affected by the hormonal receptor status .
A 2 year peak of recurrence is seen in patients with hormone receptor-negative tumors as well as in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors , but the peak is more pronounced in those with hormone receptor-negative tumors .
Among hormone receptor-positive tumors , a higher incidence of early relapses ( within the first 2 - 2.5 years ) is observed in patients with HER2 overexpression , low ER levels , high number ( 4 ) of metastatic axillary lymph nodes , poor histological grade , large tumor size , and presence of vascular invasion .
Patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors retain a high risk of recurrence more than 5 years after the diagnosis .
The majority of breast cancer recurrences are DM , which represent the most significant challenge and threatens patients survival .
Adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence , including DM , but the AIs have been shown to be superior to tamoxifen at reducing recurrence risk , especially the risk of DM .
All of the different strategies used to administer AIs as adjuvant therapy are able to reduce the risk of DM .
While waiting for the results of ongoing trials comparing upfront and switch strategies in patients with a new diagnosis of breast cancer , the individual risk of early recurrence may help oncologists choose between these two strategies .
For individuals at greater risk for early recurrence , an upfront AI strategy may be more appropriate than a switch strategy .
