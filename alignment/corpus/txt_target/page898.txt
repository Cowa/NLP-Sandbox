An increasing interest have been attracted for phenolics in recent years because of their significant bioactivities , such as scavenging free radicals , chelating metals , regulating enzyme activity , and modulating cell proliferation ( Rice-Evans , Miller , Paganga , 1996 ; Virgili , Kim , Packer , 1998 ) , which have been associated with the beneficial effects of polyphenol-rich diets on human health .
Recent investigations show that antioxidant activities of plant tissues are correlated with oxidative stress defense and different human diseases , including cancer , arteriosclerosis and aging processes ( [ Manosroi et al. , 1995 ] and [ Stajner et al. , 1995 ] ) .
Polyphenolic antioxidants can interfere with the oxidation process by reacting with free radicals , chelating free catalytic metals and acting as oxygen scavengers ( Sanchez-Moreno , Larrauri , Saura-Calixto , 1999 ; Shahidi Wanasundara , 1992 ) .
Thus , antioxidant defensive systems have co-evolved with aerobic metabolism to counteract oxidative damage of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .
Breast cancer is the most common diagnosed invasive cancer in women and is considered to be one of the leading causes of death due to cancer .
Breast cancer is extremely difficult to treat due to several distinct classes of tumors which exhibit different treatment responses .
Epidemiological studies have indicated the relationship between flavonoid intake and reduced risk of certain cancers ( [ Lopez-Otin and Diamandis , 1998 ] and [ Middleton et al. , 2000 ] ) .
In many studies of dietary prevention of cancer , a model of breast cancer has been established in assessing the impact of a wide variety of flavonoids for their efficacy in inhibiting cancer ( [ Wang et al. , 2005 ] and [ Zhang et al. , 2005 ] ) .
A decreased risk of breast cancer incidence has been associated with a high intake of genistein and moderate consumption of red wine ( [ Linseisen et al. , 2004 ] and [ Tomera , 1999 ] ) .
The biological and pharmacological properties of Chinese herbs have been received more attention in recent years , which is attributed to the fact that Chinese herbs contain a significant amount of phytochemicals , such as antioxidants and other bioactive compounds .
Pinus massoniana Lamb , also named as Chinese red pine , mountain pine or green pine , belongs to gymnosperms and is one species of Pinaceae sub .
Pine bark extract is a unique mixture of flavonoids , which comprises 8% ( w / w ) of flavonoid monomers and 85% ( w / w ) of condensed flavonoids identified mainly as procyanidins  .
These procyanidins are mainly constituted by the flavan-3-ols , catechin and epicatechin , which link together from dimers up to heptamers  .
It is reported that the bark extract of the French marine pine can protect the low-density fraction of human plasma lipoproteins against copper-induced oxidation and DNA from iron / ascorbate-induced damage ( Nelson , Lau , Ide , Rong , 1998 ) .
Moreover , French marine pine can also protect cellular systems by increasing the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione redox enzymes ( GSH reductase and GSH peroxidase ) , superoxide dismutase and catalase ( Rong , Li , Lau , 1995 ) .
Unfortunately , there is very limited in formation about antioxidant activities and other biological activities of PEPB .
In the present study , inhibition effect on linoleic-acid peroxidation , reducing power , metal chelating ability , DPPH and nitric-oxide radical scavenging activities of PEPB were investigated .
The immunomodulatory and anti-breast cancer activities of PEPB were also evaluated .
2. Materials and methods2.1 .

Fetal calf serum , penicillin and streptomycin were obtained from Zhongshan University ( Guangzhou , China ) .
All other chemicals used were of analytical grade .
2.2. Preparation of PEPB .
The air-dried barks of P. massionana Lamb ( at the mature stage ) were ground into powders .
The powders ( 200 g ) were extracted with 60% ethanol with a ratio of 1:20 ( w / v ) for 2 h at 50 C. The extract was then filtered through muslin .
The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure and vacuum-dried , then used for following bioassays .
The yield of PEPB was about 22% ( w / w ) with reference to the dried bark .
2.3. Determination of antioxidant activity with FTC method .
The antioxidant activity of PEPB on inhibition of linoleic-acid peroxidation was determined by the FTC method ( Mitsuda , Yasumoto , Iwani , 1996 ) .
A methanolic solution ( 2.5 ml ) of each sample was mixed with 2.5 ml of 0.02 M linoleic-acid emulsion in phosphate buffer ( pH 7.0 ) .
The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 C to accelerate the oxidation process .
9.7 ml of 75% ethanol and 0.1 ml of 30% ammonium thiocyanate was added to 0.1 ml of this solution .
Precisely 3 min after the addition of 0.1 ml of 0.02 M ferrous chloride in 3.5% ( w / v ) hydrochloric acid to the reaction mixture , the peroxide value was determined by reading the absorbance at 500 nm for every 12 h until the absorbance of the blank ( the extract sample at 0 g / ml ) reached maximum .
The solutions without PEPB were used as the control .
Distilled water was used as blank .
The antioxidant activities of vitamin E and C as standard reference were also assayed .
The percent inhibition of lipid peroxidation of linoleic-acid emulsion was calculated as follows :
where A0 was the absorbance of the control , while A1 was the absorbance in the presence of the samples ( Gl√ßin , Oktay , Kfrevioglu , Aslan , 2002 ) .
All the tests were carried out in triplicates .
2.4. Assay of DPPH radical scavenging activity .
The assay of DPPH radical scavenging activity was carried out by the method of Shimada , Fujikawa , Yahara , and Nakamura ( 1996 ) , with some modifications .
Briefly , 2 ml of 0.1 mM DPPH in ethanol solution was added to 2 ml of PEPB solution in ethanol at 2 - 200 g / ml , and then the mixture solution was maintained for 30 min in the dark .
The absorbance was measured at 517 nm .
A low absorbance of the reaction mixture indicates a high radical scavenging activity .
The antioxidant activities of vitamin C and TBHQ as standard reference were also assayed .
The solutions without PEPB were used as the control .
Ethanol was used as blank .
All the tests were performed in triplicates .
The inhibition of DPPH radicals by the samples was calculated as follows :
2.5. Reducing power .
The reducing power of PEPB was determined by the method of Yen , Duh , and Tsai ( 1993 ) .
Different concentrations of PEPB ( dissolved in methanol ) were mixed with 2.5 ml of 0.2 M phosphate buffer ( pH 6.6 ) and 2.5 ml of 1% potassium ferricyanide .
The mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 50 C. After incubation , 2.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid were added to the mixtures , followed by centrifugation at 2160 g for 10 min .
The supernatant ( 2.5 ml ) was collected and then mixed with 2.5 ml of distilled water and 0.5 ml of 0.1% ferric chloride .
The absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at 700 nm .
The antioxidant activities of vitamin E , vitamin C and BHA as standard reference were also assayed .
Distilled water was used as blank .
All the tests were carried out in triplicates .
2.6. Metal chelating ability .
The chelating ability of ferrous ions of PEPB was estimated by the method of Dinis , Madeira , and Almeida ( 1994 ) .
Briefly , PEPB solutions at 50 - 250 g / ml were added to 0.05 ml of 2 mM FeCl2 .
The reaction was initiated after the addition of 0.2 ml of 5 mM ferrozine .
The mixture was shaken vigorously and kept at room temperature ( 25 C ) for 10 min .
The absorbance of the solution was then measured at 562 nm .
The antioxidant activities of BHA , BHT and EDTA as standard reference were also assayed .
Distilled water was used as blank .
All the tests were carried out in triplicates .
2.7. Assay of nitric-oxide scavenging activity .
The scavenging activity of PEPB on nitric-oxide was measured according to the method of Marcocci , Maguire , Droy-Lefaiz , and Packer ( 1994 ) .
The method is based on the principle that sodium nitroprusside in a aqueous solution at physiological pH spontaneously generates nitric-oxide which interacts with oxygen to produce nitrite ions that can be estimated using a Griess reagent  .
Scavengers of nitric-oxide act against oxygen , leading to reduced production of nitrite ions .
In this experiment , 2 ml of PEPB was added to 0.5 ml of 25 mM sodium nitroprusside ( SNP ) solution , and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature ( 25 C ) for 90 min .
The Griess reagent ( 1.5 ml , 1% sulfanilamide in 5% H3PO4 and 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride ) were then added to the mixture .
The absorbance of the chromophore formed during diazotization of the nitrite with sulfanilamide and subsequent coupling with naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride was immediately recorded at 540 nm .
The antioxidant activities of BHA and BHT as standard reference were also assayed .
Distilled water was used as blank .
All the tests were carried out in triplicates .
2.8. Determination of total phenolic content .
The total phenolic content ( TPC ) was determined by the Folin - Ciocalteu method ( Singleton , Orthofer , Lamuela-Raventos , 1999 ) .
Briefly , the extract was dissolved in methanol .
Extract solution ( 0.5 ml ) was mixed with 0.5 ml of the Folin - Ciocalteau reagent .
After 3 min , 0.5 ml of Na2CO3 ( 1% ) was added , while the mixture was allowed to stand for 2 h with intermittent shaking at room temperature ( 25 C ) .
The absorbance was measured at 760 nm .
Total phenolic content was expressed as mg of gallic-acid equivalents ( GCE ) on dry weight ( DW ) basis .
2.9. Animals .
Normal female BALB / c mice ( 2 - 3 months old ) from the Zhongshan University ( Guangzhou , China ) were maintained in a pathogen-free environment .
They were allowed continuous free access to standard laboratory chow and fresh water .
The mice were allowed to acclimatize for 7 to 10 days prior to experiments .
2.10. Cell line and culture .
Human breast cancer MCF-7 and HELF cell lines were obtained from the immune system analysis laboratory of Zhongshan University ( Guangzhou , China ) .
The cells were maintained in the RPMI-1640 complete medium in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 C. .
Mice were killed by cervical dislocation and spleens were removed aseptically .
Single cells were prepared by mincing spleen fragments and pressing them through a stainless 200 mesh screen in the RPMI complete medium  .
The RPMI-1640 complete medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum , 2 mM l-glutamine , 50 M -mercaptoethanol , penicillin ( 100 U / ml ) and streptomycin ( 100 g / ml ) .
An amount of 1107 cells was placed in a 16 mm well and incubated for 3 h in a humidified 5% CO2 at 37 C. The supernatant together with the non-adherent cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min .
The cell pellets were re-suspended in the RPMI complete medium and then adjusted to 1106 cells / ml ( Manosroi , Saraphanchotiwitthaya , Manosroi , 2006 ) .
2.11. In vitro proliferation assay .
The proliferation stimulatory effects of PEPB on the splenocytes and the cytotoxicity to both MCF-7 and HELF cells were evaluated by the 3- ( 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay method described previously ( Sun , Qin , Pan , 2005 ) .
Briefly , 20 l of 0 - 500 g / ml PEPB , paclitaxel or rutin , which was dissolved in ethanol diluted with RPMI 1640 and then added into the wells , was added to 20 l of cell suspension ( 1106 cells / ml ) and 40 l of RPMI in a 96 well flat-bottom plate .
Control cells were incubated with a media containing an equivalent solvent amount without the test materials .
The final solvent concentrations were in a range of 0.5 - 1% .
In this experiment , it was found that the concentration level did not alter cell growth .
The plate was incubated at 37 C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere .
After 44 h , 50 l of MTT solution ( 5 mg / ml ) was added to each well and then incubated for 4 h .
The supernatant was removed carefully by pipetting from wells without disturbing the attached cells and formazan crystals were solubilized by adding 200 l of DSMO to each well and shaken for 15 min .
The absorbance at 570 nm was measured with a microplate reader ( Bio-Rad , Richmond , CA ) , using wells without cells as control .
All the experiments were performed in triplicates .
The PEPB on the proliferation of MCF-7 and HELF was calculated from the following formula :
while the stimulatory effect ( % ) of PEPB on the proliferation of splenocytes was calculated as follows :
2.12. Statistical analyses .
All the data were expressed as mean standard deviation ( SD ) of three replicated determinations .
Statistical calculations by OriginPro Version 7.5 software ( OriginLab Corporation , USA ) were carried out .
One way of variance analysis was applied for determining differences between results of samples .
Values of P 0.05 were considered as significantly different .
3. Results and discussion3.1 .
Antioxidant activity of PEPB on linoleic acid peroxidation .
In this study , total phenolic content of PEPB measured was 114.15 mg GCE / g DW , which showed the pine bark was a rich source of polyphenols .
The antioxidant activity of PEPB was measured using FTC system .
The FTC method is used to measure the peroxide level during the initial stage of lipid oxidation .
During linoleic-acid oxidation , peroxides are formed and oxidize Fe2+ into Fe3+ , resulting in a maximum absorbance at 500 nm .
Low absorbance value indicates high level of antioxidant activity ( Duh , Tu , Yen , 1999 ) .
As shown in Table 1 , PEPB exhibited a dose-dependent antioxidant activity .
At the concentration of 100 g / ml , PEPB had the highest percent inhibition of 90.38% , followed by vitamin E ( 88.61% ) and C ( 85.68% ) , which suggested that the antioxidant activity of the PEPB against linoleic acid peroxidation was higher than that of vitamin E or C. .

3.2. DPPH radical scavenging activity .
DPPH assay was used to evaluate the ability of antioxidants to scavenge free radicals .
As shown in Fig. 1 , the scavenging activities of PEPB , vitamin C and TBHQ on DPPH radicals were compared .
PEPB had a stronger scavenging activity on the DPPH radicals and the effect enhanced with increasing concentration in the range of 2 - 100 g / ml .
However , no significant difference ( P 0.05 ) was observed between the scavenging activity at 100 and 200 g / ml .
PEPB exhibited the highest scavenging activity ( 95.1% ) , followed by vitamin C ( 94.45% ) and TBHQ ( 91.55% ) , at 200 g / ml .

3.3. Assay of nitric-oxide scavenging activity .
It is well-known that nitric-oxide ( NO ) has an important role in various types of inflammatory processes in the animal body .
The scavenging NO activity may help arresting the chain of reactions initiated by excess generation of NO that are detrimental to human health  .
The scavenging activities of PEPB , BHT and BHA on NO radical were evaluated , respectively .
As shown in Fig. 2 , PEPB had a stronger nitric-oxide scavenging activity at 25 - 200 g / ml .
The inhibition effect enhanced with increasing concentration .
PEPB exhibited 68.9% of NO radical scavenging activity as 200 g / ml was used , which was significantly ( P 0.05 ) higher than BHA ( 37.2% ) and BHT ( 57.9% ) .

3.4. Reducing power .
A good correlation between antioxidant activity and reducing power in some plant extracts has been proved ( Yen , Chen , Peng , 2000 ) .
Therefore , the reducing capacity may used as an indicator of the potential antioxidant activity. Fig. 3 showed the reducing power of PEPB , compared with BHA , vitamin E and C. The PEPB had a dose-dependent reducing power .
At the same concentration used , the reducing power of PEPB was higher than BHA , vitamin E and C. .

3.5. Metal chelating ability .
The metal chelating abilities of PEPB and standard antioxidants were determined by evaluating their capacity to compete with ferrozine for the ferrous ions .
Ferrozine can quantitatively form complexes with Fe2+ .
In the presence of chelating agents , the complex formation is disrupted , resulting in reduced red colour of the complexes .
Therefore , measurement of the rate of colour reduction allows estimation of the chelating ability of the coexisting chelator ( Yamaguchi , Ariga , Yoshimira , Nakazawa , 2000 ) .
As shown in Fig. 4 , the formation of ferrozine-Fe2+ complex was not complete in the presence of PEPB .
Furthermore , the ability of chelating ferrous ions was enhanced with increasing PEPB concentration .
The metal chelating ability of PEPB was greater than that of BHT but lower than that of BHA .
The difference between PEPB and EDTA was statistically significant ( P 0.05 ) .
While , 100 g / ml of BHA , BHT and EDTA showed 58.3 , 28.24 and 76.9% of ferrous-ion chelating ability , respectively .
It is reported that chelating agents are effective as secondary antioxidants because they reduce the redox potential , thereby stabilising the oxidized form of the metal ion ( [ Gardner et al. , 2000 ] and [ Yen et al. , 1993 ] ) .
The data in this study exhibited PEPB had an effective ability for iron binding .

3.6. Immunomodulatory activity of PEPB .
The immunomodulatory activity of PEPB was investigated using the proliferation of splenocytes .
As shown in Fig. 5 , at 32.5 - 500 g / ml , the PEPB markedly stimulated the proliferation of splenocytes in a dose-dependent manner .
When the concentration of PEPB was 32.5 g / ml , the lowest concentration used in this study exhibited significantly ( P 0.05 ) stimulatory effect on splenocyte proliferation .
The concentrations ( 32.5 - 500 g / ml ) used in this study of PEPB exhibited 45.6 , 63.4 , 79.5 , 84.1 and 115.3% of stimulatory effects on the proliferation of splenocytes , respectively .
While , rutin showed 14.7 , 18.2 , 19.9 , 19.7 and 21.2% of stimulatory effects , respectively .
The results revealed that PEPB exhibited stronger stimulatory effects on proliferation of mouse splenocytes than rutin .
Similar results have been reported for plant extracts and propolis flavone ( [ Kong et al. , 2004 ] and [ Lin et al. , 2005 ] ) .

3.7. Anti-breast cancer activity of P.massoniana lamb bark extract .
Table 2 presented the cytotoxicity to MCF-7 cells by PEPB and paclitaxel at various concentrations after 72 h of treatment .
PEPB significantly inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation in a dose-dependant manner at higher concentrations than 32.5 g / ml ( P 0.05 ) .
26.52% and 60.46% of cytotoxicities by PEPB at 32.5 and 500 g / ml were observed , respectively .
The median effective dose ( EC50 ) of PEPB for the inhibition of MCF-7 cell proliferation was 48.6 g / ml .
On the other hand , paclitaxel , being approved by FDA as an anticancer drug , showed a strong cytotoxicity to MCF-7 and HELF .
The cytotoxicity to MCF-7 by paclitaxel at 32.5 g / ml was beyond 50% .
As 125 g / ml was used , the cytotoxicities to MCF-7 and HELF by paclitaxel were 71.1% and 62.7% , respectively .
The results suggested that paclitaxel exhibited a good inhibitory effect on cancer cell proliferation , but it could damage normal cell .

As shown in Table 3 , at concentrations tested , PEPB exhibited a different cytotoxity to HELF cells and a dose-dependent effect on cell viability and proliferation .
Furthermore , PEPB was relatively safer to non-cancerous cells ( less cytotoxicity observed at the range from 32.5 to 125 g / ml ) than paclitaxel .
This observation suggested PEPB as an attractive component may be used as a potentially anticancer agent .

4. Conclusion .
PEPB exhibited a strong antioxidant activity in the five models studied , including total antioxidant activity , free radical scavenging activity , metal chelating ability and nitric-oxide scavenging activity .
The antioxidant activity of PEPB might be attributed to effective hydrogen-donating ability , metal-chelating capability , and their effectiveness as good scavengers of hydrogen peroxide and free radicals .
PEPB also showed a stronger stimulatory effect on the proliferation of mouse splenocytes than rutin .
In addition , PEPB could inhibit growth of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells at 32.5 - 125 g / ml , which had a lower toxicity on HELF than paclitaxel .
The results obtained from this study suggested that PEPB could be used as an easy accessible source of natural antioxidants and as a possible supplement in pharmaceutical industry .
The major components responsible for the immunomodulatory and anticancer activities need to be further investigated .
