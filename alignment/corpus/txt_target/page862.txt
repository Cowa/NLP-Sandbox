The estrogen receptors ( ERs ) are attractive targets in the treatment of breast cancer and the development of receptor-based breast cancer imaging agents for diagnostic use in biomedical imaging technique positron emission tomography ( PET )  .
The positron labeled steroidal estrogen 16- [ 18F ] fluoro-17-estradiol , a 17 estradiol derivative and a well-known ER radioligand as indicated in Fig. 1 , has been developed as a PET breast cancer ER imaging agent  .
A number of selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) such as tamoxifen and 4 hydroxytamoxifen are currently in advanced clinical trials or in the market for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer  .
Recently , a series of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives have been developed as new and potent SERMs , and they are found to bind with high affinity to the two currently known ERs , ER and ER , and specificity exhibiting up to 50 folds for ER over ER  .
Tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives labeled with a positron emitting radionuclide carbon-11 or fluorine-18 may enable non-invasive monitoring of ER expression in breast cancer and breast cancer response to hormone therapy .
We are interested in the development of PET breast cancer imaging agents .
In our previous works , we have developed carbon-11 labeled cyclofenil derivatives as new potential PET nonsteroidal estrogen radioligands for imaging ER expression in breast cancer  .
This ongoing study was to develop new SERM radioligands .
To further develop therapeutic agent for diagnostic use , we have first designed , synthesized and evaluated carbon-11 labeled tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives , [ 11C ] methyl 1- ( 2- ( 4- ( 2- ( 4 fluorophenyl ) -6-hydroxy-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl ) phenoxy ) ethyl ) piperidine-4-carboxylate ( [ 11C ] 10a ) and [ 11C ] methyl 1- ( 2- ( 4- ( 2- ( 4 chlorophenyl ) -6-hydroxy-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl ) phenoxy ) ethyl ) piperidine-4-carboxylate ( [ 11C ] 10b ) as new potential SERM radioligands for PET imaging of ER expression in breast cancer .

Compounds 10a,b were selected as the lead candidates for PET radioligand development for reasons of ER selectivity , potency and feasibility of chemical modification to incorporate an O-methyl group at the ester moiety .
The O-methyl group serves as a platform for radiolabeling of this series of methyl ester compounds with a positron emitting radioisotope carbon-11 as potential PET radiopharmaceuticals .
Compounds 10a,b ( 10a , X = F ; 10b , X = Cl ) are halo-tetrahydroisoquinoline compounds , and they are amenable to labeling with another positron emitting radioisotope fluorine-18 by a conventional nucleophilic substitution with K [ 18F ] F / Kryptofix 2.2.2  to be new fluorine-18 PET agents .
In this regard , compound 10b could be the precursor for compound 10a in fluorine-18 radiolabeling reaction .
2.2. Radiochemistry .
Synthesis of the target tracers , carbon-11 labeled tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives [ 11C ] 10a,b is outlined in Scheme 2. The precursor 11a or 11b was labeled by [ 11C ] methyl triflate ( [ 11C ] CH3OTf )  through O- [ 11C ] methylation  and isolated by a simplified solid-phase extraction ( SPE ) purification  to produce corresponding pure target radiolabeled compound [ 11C ] 10a or [ 11C ] 10b with 40 - 60% radiochemical yields , based on [ 11C ] CO2 , decay corrected to end of bombardment ( EOB ) .
The large polarity difference between the acid precursor and the labeled O-methylated ester product permitted the use of SPE technique for purification of labeled product from radiolabeling reaction mixture .
Either a light C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge or a semi-prep C-18 guard cartridge column was used in SPE purification technique .
The reaction mixture was loaded onto the cartridge by gas pressure .
The cartridge was washed with water to remove non-reacted [ 11C ] CH3OTf , acid precursor and reaction solvent , and then final labeled product was eluted with ethanol .
Overall synthesis time was 15 - 20 min from EOB .
SPE technique is fast , efficient and convenient and works very well for the O-methylated tracer production .
The radiosynthesis was performed in an automated multi-purpose 11C-radiosynthesis module , allowing measurement of specific activity during synthesis  .
The specific activity was estimated in a range of 74 - 111 GBq / mol at the end of synthesis ( EOS ) based on other compounds produced using the same targetry conditions which have been measured by the on-the-fly technique  .
The actual measurement of specific activity at EOS by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) method  is in agreement with this estimation .
The specific activity obtained in our automated synthesis module was high , since the methylation reagent we used was no-carrier-added ( high specific activity ) [ 11C ] CH3OTf , which was produced by the gas-phase production method  from [ 11C ] CO2 through [ 11C ] CH4 and [ 11C ] CH3Br with silver triflate ( AgOTf ) column .
In addition , we used very small amount of the precursor 11a or 11b ( 0.1 - 0.3 mg ) in radiosynthesis , which also improved the specific activity data .
Chemical purity and radiochemical purity were determined by analytical HPLC method .
The chemical purity of precursors and reference standards was 95% .
The radiochemical purity of target tracers was 99% determined by radio-HPLC through -ray ( NaI ) flow detector , and the chemical purity of target tracers was 95% determined by reversed-phase HPLC through UV flow detector .

The O- [ 11C ] methylation of phenolic hydroxyl position on the precursor to form undesired radiolabeled ether byproduct is a potential competing reaction , however , our previous results  have indicated that the O- [ 11C ] methylation of acid position on the precursor to form desired radiolabeled ester product will be a major reaction .
These results are consistent with the theoretical explanation that the deprotonization at the acid position of the precursor is much easier than at the phenolic hydroxyl positions of the precursor , since the acidity of HO - at the acid position of the precursor is greater than at the phenolic hydroxyl position of the precursor , and the O- [ 11C ] methylation of the precursor will prefer to occur at the acid position rather than at the phenolic hydroxyl position .
In addition , the minimal formation of the undesired labeled byproduct , estimated to be 5% , will be washed out with non-reacted [ 11C ] CH3OTf , acid precursor and reaction solvent by water during the SPE purification , since their polarities are very similar .
To prove that alkylation indeed occurred at the carboxylate-O and not the phenylate-O , a control experiment was designed and conducted using a previously reported procedure from our laboratory  .
Briefly , the precursor 11a or 11b ( 0.1 - 0.3 mg ) was dissolved in CH3CN ( 0.5 mL ) .
To this solution were added 3 N NaOH ( 2 L ) and 20 mM CH3OTf ( 50 L ) .
The mixture was stirred at room temperature ( rt ) for 10 min , and the reaction was monitored by the analytical HPLC method aforementioned .
The results showed that precursor 11a or 11b was completely converted to compound 10a or 10b , respectively , as indicated by their retention times ( tR 11a = 1.69 min , tR 10a = 4.03 min ; and tR 11b = 1.71 min , tR 10b = 3.06 min ) on HPLC chromatograms .
These chromatographic data support our conclusion .
2.3. MCF-7 cell proliferation assay .
Compounds 10a,b were designed and synthesized through a slight structural modification based on a novel series of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives , potent SERMs , recently developed by Renaud et al. , which have been fully evaluated by radioligand binding assay and estrogen response element ( ERE ) assay to ER and ER , and inhibition of MCF-7 cell proliferation assay  .
Thus , we can assume that the slight structural modification of compounds 10a,b would not significantly change their biological activity in light of the structure - activity relationship ( SAR ) .
The preliminary biological evaluation of the synthesized new tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives 10a,b was performed via an MCF-7 cell proliferation assay  and compared to 4 hydroxytamoxifen .
4-Hydroxytamoxifen ( IC50 8.5 8.0 nM in MCF-7 cells ) is a more potent SERM than its parent compound tamoxifen ( IC50 580160 nM in MCF-7 cells )  , and MCF-7 cell line is an ER positive human breast cancer cell line  .
The results are shown in Fig. 2. As indicated in Fig. 2 , proliferation of MCF-7 cells was inhibited by 0.625 nM of 4 hydroxytamoxifen , also by higher concentrations .
MCF-7 cell proliferation was inhibited only by 0.625 nM of compound 10a , but not by higher concentrations .
Similar to 4 hydroxytamoxifen , proliferation of MCF-7 cells was inhibited by 0.3125 - 0.625 nM of compound 10b , also by higher concentrations .
Taken collectively , these results suggest that the new compounds 10a,b were proved to be potent SERMs with very high binding affinity to ER , comparable to that of the reference compound 4 hydroxytamoxifen under our assay conditions .

3. Conclusion .
An efficient and convenient synthesis of new carbon-11 labeled tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives has been well developed .
The synthetic methodology employed classical organic chemistry such as cyclization , arylation , debenzylation , alkylation , demethylation and hydrolysis reactions to synthesize unlabeled tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives .
Carbon-11 labeling at oxygen position of the precursor through O- [ 11C ] methylation was incorporated efficiently using [ 11C ] CH3OTf , a signature reaction of carbon-11 radiochemistry from our laboratory .
Radiosynthesis produced new radioligands in amounts and purity suitable for the preclinical application in animal studies using PET .
Labeled products are suitable for injection , with the higher specific radioactivities in a range of 74 - 111 GBq / mol at EOS , and can be obtained within 20 min from EOB including fast and efficient SPE purification and formulation .
Preliminary findings from in vitro biological assay indicate that the synthesized new tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives displayed similar potencies in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line in comparison with reference compound 4 hydroxytamoxifen .
These results encourage further in vivo evaluation of carbon-11 labeled tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives as new potential SERM radioligands for PET imaging of ER expression in breast cancer .

General method for the preparation of carbon-11 labeled tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives , [ 11C ] methyl 1- ( 2- ( 4- ( 2- ( 4 fluorophenyl ) -6-hydroxy-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl ) phenoxy ) ethyl ) piperidine-4-carboxylate ( [ 11C ] 10a ) and [ 11C ] methyl 1- ( 2- ( 4- ( 2- ( 4 chlorophenyl ) -6-hydroxy-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl ) phenoxy ) ethyl ) piperidine-4-carboxylate ( [ 11C ] 10b )
[ 11C ] CO2 was produced by the 14N ( p, ) 11C nuclear reaction in small volume ( 9.5 cm3 ) aluminum gas target ( CTI ) from 11 MeV proton cyclotron on research purity nitrogen ( +1% O2 ) in a Siemens radionuclide delivery system ( Eclipse RDS-111 ) .
The acid precursor 11a or 11b ( 0.1 - 0.3 mg ) was dissolved in CH3CN ( 300 L ) .
To this solution was added 3 N NaOH ( 2 L ) .
The mixture was transferred to a small reaction vial. [ 11C ] CH3OTf that was produced from [ 11C ] CO2 through [ 11C ] CH4 and [ 11C ] CH3Br with AgOTf column was passed into the reaction vial , which was cooled to 0 C , until radioactivity reached a maximum ( 2 min ) , and then the reaction vial was isolated and heated at 80 C for 3 min .
The contents of the reaction vial were diluted with NaHCO3 ( 1 mL , 0.1 M ) .
The reaction tube was connected to either a light C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge or a semi-prep C-18 guard cartridge column .
The labeled product mixture solution was passed onto the cartridge for SPE purification by gas pressure .
The cartridge was washed with H2O ( 3 mL 2 ) , and the aqueous washing was discarded .
The product was eluted from the column with EtOH ( 3 mL 2 ) , and then passed onto a rotatory evaporator .
The solvent was removed by evaporation under vacuum .
The labeled product [ 11C ] 10a or [ 11C ] 10b was formulated with saline , sterile-filtered through a sterile vented Millex-GS 0.22 m cellulose acetate membrane and collected into a sterile vial , whose volume was dependent upon the use of the labeled product in tissue biodistribution studies ( 6 mL , 2 mL 3 ) or in PET imaging studies ( 1 - 3 mL ) .
Total radioactivity was assayed and the total volume ( 1.0 - 6.0 mL ) was noted .
The overall synthesis time including SPE purification and formulation was 15 - 20 min .
The radiochemical yields were 40 - 60% decay corrected to EOB from [ 11C ] CO2 and 20 - 30% at EOS , respectively .
Retention times in the analytical HPLC system were : tR 11a = 1.69 min , tR 10a = 4.03 min , tR [ 11C ] 10a = 4.03 min ; and tR 11b = 1.71 min , tR 10b = 3.06 min , tR [ 11C ] 10b = 3.06 min .
4.21. MCF-7 cell proliferation assay .
MCF-7 cell proliferation assay was performed following a literature procedure  .
Briefly , cell proliferation was performed using Celltiter96 kits .
For proliferation assays , 100 L of medium containing 5000 MCF-7 breast cancer cells was plated in a 96 well flat-bottom microplate ( Becton Dickinson Co. , Lincoln Park , NJ ) and was incubated at 37 C for 24 h in the presence of 0.156 - 10 nM of reference compound 4 hydroxytamoxifen , and synthesized new compounds 10a,b .
Following treatment , 20 L of the reagent , the tetrazolium compound MTS ( Promega , Madison , WI ) , was added to each well , and incubation was continued at 37 C for 1 h .
The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm .
Control cells were not incubated with 4 hydroxytamoxifen and 10a,b .
Each series was performed in triplicate .
