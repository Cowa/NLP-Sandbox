The North American perennial black cohosh ( Actaea racemosa L ; Ranunculaceae ) and related Cimicifuga species have been used for centuries , across many cultures , for a variety of health benefits .
Native Americans used black cohosh as an anti-inflammatory agent  .
Related Asian Cimicifuga species have been used in China and Japan as antipyretic and analgesic agents  , as well as to treat infectious diseases  .
In recent years , black cohosh has been used in the United States and Europe to relieve symptoms associated with female medical conditions , particularly menopause  .
The roots and rhizomes of the plant contain 2 major classes of compounds , triterpene glycosides and phenylpropanoids .
We and others had shown that extracts enriched in triterpene glycosides and specific triterpene glycosides isolated from black cohosh possess anticancer activity ( Nesselhut et al. , 1993 ; Dixon-Shanies and Shaikh , 1999 ; Watanabe et al. , 2002 ; Bodinet and Freudenstein , 2004 ; Einbond et al. , 2004 ; [ Hostanska et al. , 2004a ] and [ Hostanska et al. , 2004b ] ) , but the precise mechanism and nature of the active components are not yet known .
The purpose of this study is to determine : ( 1 ) the nature of the active anticancer components in black cohosh and related Cimicifuga species , and ( 2 ) the effect of the triterpene glycoside actein on the morphology of human breast cancer cells .

Results Growth inhibitory activity of extracts of black cohosh .
Our previous experiments indicated that fractions and purified components from black cohosh inhibited the growth of human breast cancer cells .
Of the cells tested , the Her2 overexpressing MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells were the most sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of the ethyl acetate fraction and the purified triterpene glycoside actein from black cohosh .
MDA-MB-453 cells overexpress the Her2 , FGF and AR receptors and are mutant for p53 , and they are ER negative .
Guided by the results of these previous experiments , we tested the growth inhibitory activity of extracts of black cohosh roots and rhizomes , containing different percents of triterpene glycosides on MDA-MB-453 human breast cancer cells in order to explore the nature of the active components .
Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of the agents for 96 h and the number of viable cells was determined by the Coulter Counter assay , as shown in Fig. 2. The extract with a low concentration of triterpene glycosides ( 1% ) resulted in no inhibition of cell growth .
The IC50 value , the concentration that caused 50% inhibition of cell proliferation , for the extract with 15% triterpene glycosides was 29 g / ml , and for the extract with 27% triterpene glycosides , the IC50 value was 12 g / ml .
An IC50 value of 4.5 g / ml ( 6.7 M ) was obtained with the purified triterpene glycoside actein .
The percent of the polyphenol isoferulic acid in the respective three fractions was : 1.8 ; 0.7 ; and 0.6% .

Growth inhibitory activity of compounds from Cimicifuga species .
Our previous experiments  indicated that of the black cohosh triterpene glycosides tested , actein was the most potent .
To further characterize the nature of the active components , we tested the effects of a series of triterpene glycosides from related Cimicifuga species on cell proliferation .
The most strongly acting component was d13 ( 25-acetyl-7,8-didehydrocimigenol 3-O--d-xylopyranoside ) which has an acetyl group at position C-25 ; it had an IC50 of 3.2 g / ml ( 5 M ) compared to 7.2 g / ml ( 12.1 M ) for the parent compound d11 ( 7,8 didehydrocimigenol 3-O--d-xylopyranoside ) , which lacks the acetyl residue .
Compound d6 ( 24-epi-7,8-didehydrocimigenol 3-O--d-xylopyranoside ) , the 24 epi derivative of compound d11 , exhibited efficacy similar to that of d11 ( IC50=7.2 g / ml ; 11.7 M ) .
Actein ( -d-xylopyranoside ) , with an IC50 equal to 5.7 g / ml ( 8.4 M ) , exhibited activity comparable to cimigenol 3-O--d-xyloside , which had an IC50 value of 6 g / ml ( 9 M ) .
Compound d10 ( 24-O-acetylisodahurinol 3-O--l-arabinopyranoside ) , a 24 acetyl derivative , possessed the next highest activity , with an IC50 value of 15 g / ml ( 24.9 M ) .
Compounds C2 ( 22R ) -22-hydroxy cimigenol 3-O--d-xylopyranoside} and d8 ( 12 -hydroxycimigenol 3-O--l-arabinopyranoside ) , hydroxyl derivatives of compound A1 , exhibited less growth inhibitory activity , with IC50 values of 29 g / ml ( 46 M ) and 55 g / ml ( 87 M ) , respectively .
Compound dE ( 3-O--l-arabinopyranosyl cimigenol 15-O--d-glucopyranoside ) , which possesses several sugar residues , was also less active , with an IC50 value of about 72 g / ml ( 90 M ) .
Colony formation assay .
To ascertain the anticancer potential of actein , we tested the effect of actein on the ability of MDA-MB-453 cells to form colonies .
The colonies were smaller on average in the actein treated cells : the IC50 values after 24 and 96 h were 33 g / ml ( 48.7 M ) and 10 g / ml ( 14.8 M ) , respectively .

Fluorescent microscopy of the effects of actein on human breast cancer cells .
We observed two effects of actein on MCF7 and MDA-MB-453 cell structure by fluorescent microscopy : ( 1 ) there were fewer cells in mitosis in the MCF7 cells treated with actein at 20 g / ml for 48 h , and ( 2 ) the distribution of actin filaments was altered after treatment with actein in both the MCF7 and MDA-MB-453 cells .
In the untreated cells , actin was primarily beneath the cell membrane , whereas in the actein treated cells , actin was dispersed in the cytoplasm and also present around the nucleus .
Furthermore , the nuclei had a donut-shape , which is characteristic of apoptotic cells .

Discussion .
This study examined the growth inhibitory activity of extracts and purified components from Cimicifuga species on human breast cancer cells .
Our results support the hypothesis that the growth inhibitory effect of black cohosh on human breast cancer cells is primarily due to the triterpene glycoside fraction .
In additional unpublished studies we tested the activity of individual components of the black cohosh caffeic acid ( polyphenol ) fraction .
The IC50 values of the polyphenols cimicifugic acid G  , A and B , fukinolic acid , ferulic and isoferulic acid were greater than 100 M on MDA-MB-453 cells .
Although these polyphenols were more active on MCF7 cells than MDA-MB-453 cells , they displayed very weak activity on both cell lines .
Our present and previous results indicate that the percent inhibition of cell proliferation is related to the triterpene glycoside content of back cohosh and not the isoferulic content ; however , we cannot exclude a role for this polyphenolic fraction or other components .
Our results contradict the finding of Hostanska_et_al.  that the caffeic acid ester ( CAE ) fraction is more active than the triterpene glycoside fraction on MCF7 , ER+ , human breast cancer cells .
This difference in results could be due to the use of different subclones , experimental procedures or incubation media , or to the fact that the polyphenols and triterpene glycosides differ in molecular weight .
Thus , Hostanska_et_al.  performed their assays in estrogen-free medium and were only able to find increased activity for the CAE fraction in the crystal violet and early apoptosis assays .
The acetyl group at position C-25 appears to be important for the growth inhibitory activity of the triterpene glycoside compound d13 ( 25-acetyl-7,8-didehydrocimigenol 3-O--d-xylopyranoside ) .
This is consistent with the findings that the acetyl derivative of boswellic acid 3-O-acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid ( AKBA ) } from Boswellia serratia  and the 16 acetate derivative of gitoxigenin from Digitalis purpurea L.  are also more active than the parent compounds .
Since the colonies in the colony formation assay were smaller on average in the actein-treated cells , actein appears to decrease the rate of cell proliferation , i.e. , actein appears to have cytostatic as well as cytotoxic activity .
Her2 may play a role in the action of actein , since MCF7 cells transfected for Her2 appear to be more sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of actein than the parental cells .
This is consistent with our finding that MDA-MB-453 cells , which are ER and Her2+ , were the most sensitive of the cells that we tested .
It is possible that the greater sensitivity of the transfected cells may reflect in part the difference in growth rates of the transfected and parental cells .
We found that treatment of MCF7 or MDA-MB-453 cells with actein altered their cell structures , since the actin filaments aggregated around the cell nuclei and the nuclei appeared donut-shaped .
These effects are consistent with actein inducing apoptosis ; the aggregation of actin around the nucleus occurs in response to cell stress  .
These results corroborate the results of our previous studies indicating that the growth inhibitory effect of actein or an extract of black cohosh is associated with activation of specific stress response pathways and apoptosis ( [ Einbond et al. , 2007a ] and [ Einbond et al. , 2007b ] ) .
Taken together , these results indicate that the triterpene glycoside actein and related compounds may be useful in the prevention and treatment of human breast cancer .
