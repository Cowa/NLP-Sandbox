The sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) is defined as the first lymph node that is in a direct drainage pathway from the primary tumor  .
In 1993 , Krag et al. first reported performing sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) using a radioactive colloid on breast cancer patients  .
Since their report , many studies have shown the feasibility and accuracy of SLNB on breast cancer , resulting in its prevalence as a technique for determining nodal staging for breast cancer  .
Lymphoscintigraphy ( LSG ) is often performed before SLNB with a radioactive colloid  .
It shows drainage from the primary tumor to the axillary nodes and shows various numbers of axillary nodes .
Chakera et al. reported that unsuccessful SLN mapping was related to patient 's age and body weight  .
Additionally , the injection site of radiotracer , patient 's age , and localization of the tumor was also reported to cause failure in visualization on LSG  .
However , the significance of the number of LSG-visualized axillary nodes is still unclear .
In this study , we have explored the potential factors that could affect the visualization of axillary node on LSG and , furthermore , we discuss the possible significance of this modality .
Patients and methods .
In this study , patients with clinical stage T0-3 , N0-1 , M0 breast cancer were retrospectively examined .
Exclusion criteria included pregnancy and neoadjuvant treatment ( e.g. , diagnostic surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) .
Informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to examination and surgery .
All patients underwent LSG and SLNB using isotope or blue dye and isotope in combination .
In the morning on the day of surgery , 185 megabecquerels of 99mTc-phytate ( Dai-ichi Radioisotope Laboratory , Tokyo , Japan ) in sterile saline ( total volume , 0.4 mL ) was injected subdermally at four sites around the tumor .
When tumors were not palpable , patients underwent periareolar injection .
After injection of radiocolloid , the breast was left unmassaged .
Shielding was used at injection sites .
LSG was performed 20 min after injection .
Anterior view of the imaged breast was obtained .
If a visualized lymph node was not defined as an area of increased uptake in the axilla , LSG was performed again 2 h after injection .
In the blue dye method , a total of 5 mL of indigo carmine dye ( Dai-ichi Seiyaku , Osaka , Japan ) was injected at four sites into the peritumor in the operating room under general anesthesia .
A 5 min postinjection massage of the entire breast was performed .
Intraoperative detection of the radioactive SLN was performed using a -detection probe ( Tyco Healthcare Japan , Tokyo , Japan ) .
A radioactive node was identified as a discrete area of radioisotope uptake , separate from the injection site , with counts greater than 25 per 10 s and clearly higher than background counts .
Each discrete radioactive SLN was removed completely until the background count was less than 10% of the most radioactive resected SLN .
SLNs were stained blue and / or radioactive .
The intraoperative frozen section analyses of the resected SLNs were performed for all patients .
All SLNs were bisected along their major axis , one section of each pair was fixed , embedded in paraffin , and stained using standard histopathological procedure .
The other section of each pair was sent for intraoperative frozen section examination .
In the event that the diameter of SLN was less than 5 mm , only one section was embedded with the cut surface up , frozen , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin .
In the event that the diameter was more than 5 mm in diameter , SLN was bisected along its major axis and one section of each pair was sliced at 2 mm intervals .
Thereafter , each specimen was evaluated as part of a frozen section examination .
For patients whose intraoperative histological result was negative for malignancy , they underwent no further axillary dissection .
The following cases continued to complete axillary dissection : ( 1 ) patients with clinically apparent positive nodes ( N1 ) ; ( 2 ) patients diagnosed as positive in intraoperative frozen section analysis ; ( 3 ) patients with no identification of SLN during procedure .
All patients underwent breast conserving surgery or mastectomy by the same specialized surgeon .
Regarding the diagnosis using LSG , the number of visualized axillary nodes was classified into three groups : ( 1 ) patients with nonvisualized nodes ; ( 2 ) patients with only one visualized node ; and ( 3 ) patients with multiple visualized nodes .
Among the three groups , patients were compared as to clinicopathological characteristics and results of SLNB .

Statistical analysis was performed using the 2 test for qualitative variables .
Quantitative variables were analyzed with one way factorial analysis of variance .
The Spearman correlation test was used to analyze the statistical correlation between the number of visualized axillary nodes and that of histological metastatic nodes .
To evaluate interactions and independent influences on factors for SLN status , multiple logistic regression models were created .
Significance was defined as P 0.05. .
Results .
Eighty-eight patients were analyzed in this study between April 2004 and January 2007 .

Results of SLNB by the number of LSG-visualized nodes are given in Table 5. SLNs were successfully identified in 66.7% of LSG-nonvisualized cases , while all patients with one or multiple LSG-visualized node were successfully identified ( P 0.0001 ) .
For patients with multiple LSG-visualized nodes , the mean number of dissected SLNs was 2.1 ( range 1 - 8 ) , being significantly higher than those with nonvisualized nodes or 1 node ( P = 0.0009 ) .
Meanwhile , the risk of SLN metastasis for one resected SLN was 8 / 51 ( 15.7% ) .
For two resected SLNs , the risk was 14 / 30 ( 46.7% ) .
For 3 resected SLNs , the risk was 5 / 7 ( 71.4% ) .
With 1 node on LSG , the risk of SLN metastasis was 14 / 61 ( 23.0% ) .
With 2 nodes , the risk was 9 / 18 ( 50% ) .
With 3 nodes , the risk was 3 / 3 ( 100% ) .
Accordingly , metastasis was found for 57.1% of SLN in patients with multiple visualized nodes on LSG , while 23.0% in patients with 1 node and 22.2% in patients with nonvisualized node had metastasis ( P = 0.011 ) .
Significant correlation was seen between the number of visualized nodes and that of histological metastatic nodes. ( P 0.006 ) .

Discussion .
SLNB has been emerging as a minimally invasive alternative to axillary lymph node dissection for nodal staging in breast cancer  .
Preoperative LSG is often carried out before SLNB with a radioactive colloid , which enables physicians and surgeons to see the migration root from primary tumor to the axillary nodes .
Regarding the clinical availability of LSG , some reports have discussed the significance of the nonvisualization of axillary nodes  .
However , the significance of the number of visualized nodes has been unclear .
Therefore , in this study we retrospectively evaluated the clinical factors which potentially could be involved in the visualization status of axillary nodes on LSG .

In our cases , successful LSG-mapping was obtained in 90.1% , and the result was acceptable compared with previous reports ( 72% - 88.4% , Table 7 ) .
The difference could be due to type or amount of isotope .
In our study 99mTc-phytate was used , while 99mTc-colloidal albumin or 99mTc-sulfur colloid was used in most other reports , and 99mTc-phytate was reported to show better accumulation compared with 99mTc-colloidal albumin  .
Additionally , in our study , 185 megabecquerels of radiocolloids was used , which was 4- to 15 fold of the amount used in the previous reports  .
In previous reports  , some have reported the following clinical factors to be significant for scintigraphic nonvisualization of axillary nodes : age , body weight , localization of the tumor , and tumor size .
Several explanations exist ; for instance , it was demonstrated that patients with no LSG-visualized nodes were older than patients with LSG-visualized nodes , suggesting that the diffusion rate of the radiotracer was slower in older patients  .
Additionally , Goyal et al. have reported that obese women ( BMI 30 ) were more likely to be negative to SLN visualization , potentially due to fatty degeneration of the lymph node , which reduced the capacity to concentrate the radiotracer  .
However , in our study , neither patient 's age nor BMI significantly correlated with the number of LSG-visualized nodes .
The results might also be affected by the type of radioisotope used or the injected dose of radioactive agent .
Moreover , in our study obese women ( BMI 30 ) were fewer , only six ( 6.5% ) .
Regarding the location of tumors , patients with nonvisualized nodes had tumors frequently located on the upper outer quadrant of their breast compared with those with one or more LSG-visualized nodes .
In most patients ( 87.9% ) , radioisotope was injected subdermally around the tumor .
Accordingly , the shine through of the radioactivity from the injection site at upper outer quadrant of the breast may have obscured the axillary nodes  .
If all patients were injected at their periareolar area , patients with nonvisualized axillary nodes might decrease .
Results of this study have shown that all patients with LSG-visualized node had SLN during surgery ( P 0.0001 ) .
On the other hand , six ( 66.7% ) of nine cases with nonvisualized nodes were shown to have SLN at surgery .
Among the six cases , two cases ( 33.3% ) detected SLN in both blue dye- and probe-guided method , and four cases ( 66.7% ) detected SLN in single probe-guided method , suggesting that even with no LSG-visualized cases , SLN could still be detected during surgery , which is supported by previous reports  .
In patients with multiple LSG-visualized nodes , the number of dissected SLN was significantly higher compared with those with nonvisualized or one visualized node ( P = 0.0009 ) .
Accordingly , we suggest that there could be several numbers of SLN left in patients with multiple LSG-visualized nodes , and SLNB should be carried out more carefully .
Moreover , patients with multiple LSG-visualized nodes have shown a higher rate of histological positive SLNs ( P = 0.011 ) .
Interestingly , the number of metastatic nodes was significantly correlated with that of LSG-visualized nodes ( P 0.006 ) .
Regarding the SLN status , in multivariate analysis , the number of LSG-visualized nodes was only the significant independent factor ( P = 0.01 ) .
The reason for these results is not clearly understood .
However , a previous study has suggested that once radiocolloids have accumulated in lymph node , their retention is associated with the status of macrophages lining the nodal sinuses  .
Accordingly , we speculate the following .
When lymph node metastasis has occurred , phagocytosis is compromised , therefore the migration of colloids to the other nodes occurs .
Eventually , the number of LSG-visualized nodes increases .
Taken together , for patients with a number of metastatic nodes , LSG could demonstrate more lymph nodes .
However , further observation must be carried out to validate any explanations included with the technical aspect of the procedure .
Conclusions .
Preoperative LSG is effective to evaluate SLN status , and the LSG-positive or LSG-negative status could be associated with the number of dissected SLN .
Moreover , the results of LSG potentially reflect the histological nodal status , which could contribute to possible improvement of successful SLNB .
