A malady has taken him over
Coughing tar in his japanese motor
The lights are magic
And he feels lucky
And he's got money
Shoots like an arrow - oh

THE MISERY OF A SPEEDING HEART

LONDON LOVES
A SPEEDING HEARTBill Barret has a simple dream
He calls it his plan B
Buildings in the sky and the air is sugar free
And everyone is very friendly
Plan B arrived on a holiday
Took a cab to the shopping malls
Bought and ate until he could do neither anymore
Then found love on channel 44

LA LA LA LA LA HE WANTS TO GO TO MAGIC AMERICA
LA LA LA LA LA HE'D LIKE TO LIVE IN MAGIC AMERICA
WITH ALL THE MAGIC PEOPLE

Bill Barrett sent his postcards home
To everyone he'd ever known they read
Fifty nine cents gets you a good square meal
From the people who care how you feel

With all the magic peopleConfidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as (parklife)
And morning soup can be avoided if you take a route straight through what is known as
(parklife)
John's got brewers droop he gets intimidated by the dirty pigeons
They love a bit of it (parklife)
Who's that gut lord marching... you should cut down on your porklife mate... get some
Exercise

ALL THE PEOPLE
SO MANY PEOPLE
THEY ALL GO HAND IN HAND
HAND IN HAND THROUGH THEIR PARKLIFE

Know what I mean
I get up when I want except on Wednesdays when I get rudely awakened by the dustmen
(Parklife)
I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea and I think about leaving the house (parklife)
I feed the pigeons I sometimes feed the sparrows too it gives me a sense of enormous well
Being (parklife)
And then I'm happy for the rest of the day safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit
Of my heart devoted to it (parklife)

Parklife (parklife)
Parklife (parklife)

It's got nothing to do with vorsprung durch technic you know
And it's not about you joggers who go round and round and round
Parklife (parklife)And into the sea goes pretty England and me
Around the Bay of Biscay and back for tea
Hit traffic on the dogger bank
Up the Thames to find a taxi rank
Sail on by with the tide and go asleep
And the radio says

THIS IS A LOW
BUT IT WON'T HURT YOU
WHEN YOU ARE ALONE IT WILL BE THERE WITH YOU
FINDING WAYS TO STAY SOLO

On the Tyne forth and Cramity
There's a low in the high forties
And Saturday's locked away on the pier
Not fast enough dear
On the Malin head, Blackpool looks blue and red
And the Queen, she's gone round the bend
Jumped off Land's End
And the radio saysAll those dirty words
They make us look so dumb
Been drinking far too much
And neither of us mean what we say

WELL YOU AND I
COLLAPSED IN LOVE
AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE MADE IT, YES IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE
MADE IT TO THE END

What happened to us
Soon it will be gone forever
Infatuated only with ourselves
And neither of us can think straight anymoreTracy Jacks works in civil service
Tracy Jacks it's steady employment
Tracy Jacks it's a golfing fanatic
Tracy Jacks but his put is erratic
Tracy Jacks saw a Harley Street doctor
Tracy Jacks who prescribed healthy living
Tracy Jacks but he's getting past forty
Tracy Jacks and all the seams are splitting

EVERYDAY HE GOT CLOSER
HE KNEW IN HIS HEART HE WAS OVER
I'D LOVE TO STAY HERE AND BE NORMAL
BUT IT'S JUST SO OVERRATED

Tracy Jacks left home without warning
Tracy Jacks at five in the morning
Tracy Jacks got on the first train to Walton
Tracy Jacks and stood on the seafront
Tracy Jacks threw his clothes in the water
Tracy Jacks and ran around naked
Tracy Jacks got stopped by the police
Tracy Jacks and escorted back home

EVERYDAY HE GOT CLOSER
HE KNEW IN HIS HEART HE WAS OVER
I'D LOVE TO STAY HERE AND BE NORMAL
BUT THEN IT'S JUST SO OVERRATED

Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks

And then it happened on a Tuesday morning
Tracy Jacks bulldozed down the house he lived in
Saying it's just so overrated
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks

EVERYDAY HE GOT CLOSER
HE KNEW IN HIS HEART HE WAS OVER
I'D LOVE TO STAY HERE AND BE NORMAL
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS OVERRATEDI am the message centre
Local and direct
Room to room an operator
No calls today they'll just have to wait dear
I call and I collect
So just strike him softly away from the body

YOU'RE MADE UP TOO SHINY TODAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
THOUGHTS ARE JUST PISSING AWAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)

I am a manager
I am in control
As the local delegator
No calls today dear they'll just have to wait dear
I offer no guarantee at all
So don't take it lightly you'll put yourself under

YOU'RE MADE UP TOO SHINY TODAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
THOUGHTS ARE JUST PISSING AWAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
A NEW TYPE FACE AND NEW DAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER TEN MINUTES AGO (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE

YOU'RE MADE UP TOO SHINY TODAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
THOUGHTS ARE JUST PISSING AWAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
A NEW TYPE FACE AND NEW DAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER TEN MINUTES AGO (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE

La la la la la

La la la laDoor bells say goodbye to the last train
Over the river they all go again
Out into leafy nowhere hope someone's waiting out there for them
Cabbie has his mind on a fare to the sun
He works nights but it's not much fun
Picks up the london yo-yos
All on their own down soho
Take me home

Other people wouldn't like to hear you
If you said that these are the best days of their lives
Other people turn around and laugh at you
If you said that these are the best days of our lives

Trellick tower's been calling
I know she'll leave me in the morning

In hotel cells listening to dull tones
Remote controls and cable moans
In his drink he's been talking
Gets disconnected sleepwalking back home

Other people wouldn't like to hear you
If you said that these are the best days of our lives
Other people turn around and laugh at you
If you said that these are the best days of our lives, of our lives

Other people wouldn't like to hear you
If you said that these are the best days of our lives
Other people turn around and laugh at you
If you said that these are the best days of our lives
Other people break into a cold sweat
If you said that these are the best days of their lives
And other people turn around and laugh at you
If you said that these are the best days of our lives, of our livesI met him in a crowded room
Where people go to drink away their gloom
He sat me down and so began
The story of a charmless man
Educated the expensive way
He knows his claret from a beaujolais
I think he'd like to have been Ronnie Kray
But then nature didn't make him that way

He thinks his educated airs those family shares
Will protect him, that you will respect him
He moves in circles of friends who just pretend that they like him
He does the same to them and when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man

He knows the swingers and their cavalry
Says he can get in anywhere for free
I began to go a little cross eyed
And from this charmless man I just had to hide

He talks at speed he gets nose bleeds
He doesn't see his days are tumbling down upon him
Yet he tries so hard to please he's just so keen for you to listen
But no-one is listening and when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless man

He thinks his educated airs, those family shares
Will protect him, that you will respect him
Yet he tries so hard to please he's just so keen for you to listen
But no-one is listening and when you put it all together
There's the model of a charmless manAnd so the the story begins

City dweller, successful fella
Thought to himself oops I've got a lot of money
I'm caught in a rat race terminally
I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit
Caught up in the centuries anxiety
It preys on him, he's getting thin

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills in the country
It's like an animal farm lot's of rural charm in the country

He's got morning glory, life's a different story
Everything going jackanory, in touch with his own mortality
He's reading balzac, knocking back prozac
It's a helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland
Oh it's the centuries remedy
For the faint at heart, a new start

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
He's got a fog in his chest so he needs a lot of rest in the country
He doesn't drink smoke laugh, takes herbal baths in the country
Says she's come to no harm on an animal farm in the country

In the country, in the country

Blow, blow me out I am so sad, I don't know why
Blow, blow me out I am so sad, I don't know why

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills in the country
Oh, it's like an animal farm lot's of rural charm in the country

He lives in a house, a very big house in the country
He's got a fog in his chest so he needs a lot of rest in the country
He doesn't drink smoke laugh, takes herbal baths in the country
And she's come to no harm on an animal farm in the countryMeanie Leanie come on down
Come and entertain the town
It's friday night and we're all bored
Times being called there is no more
Times being called it's such a bore

Dan Abnormal not normal at all
It's not his fault we made him this way
He'll imitate you, try to ape you
But it's not his fault Dan watches tv, tv, tv

Meanie Leanie stays up late
Mopes around gets in a state
The killer in your arcade
Shooting gangstas ready made
Cause that is where the future's made

Dan Abnormal not normal at all
It's not his fault we made him this way
He'll imitate you, try to ape you
But it's not his fault Dan watches tv, tv, tv

Dan went to his local burger bar
I want mcnormal and chips
Or I'll blow you to bits
Give us it

It's the miseries at half past three
Watching video nasties
He has dirty dreams when he's asleep
Dan's just like you and me
He's the Meanie Leanie

Dan Abnormal not normal at all
It's not his fault we made him this way
He'll imitate you, try to ape you
But it's not his fault Dan watches tv, tv, tv
Dan Abnormal not normal at all
It's not his fault we made him this way
He'll imitate you, try to ape you
But it's not his fault Dan's as normal as meThe weekend is back
But so is he
Head to the floodlights
See the fraternity
They're waiting
I hear them up in the north
And down in the south
And all that is spewing
Spewing out of his mouth
Entertain me, entertain me
Entertain me, entertain me

At his and hers dating
Bored minds agree
Requirements to be stated
Replies awaited
She wants a loose fit
He wants instant whip
He guesstimates her arrival
Will she want it really badly
Entertain me, entertain me
Entertain me, entertain me
Entertain me, entertain me

A car, a house both in street
The boredom of the sober week
The weekend is here hip,hip hooray
To make the blues just go away
Entertain me, entertain me
Entertain me, entertain meErnold same awoke from the same dream in the same bed at the same time
Looked in the same mirror made the same frown
And felt the same way as he did every day
Then ernold same caught the same train at the same station
Sat in the same seat with the same nasty stain next to same old what's his name
On his way to the same place to do the same thing again and again and again
Poor old ernold same

Oh ernold same, his world stays the same
Today will always be tomorrow
Poor ernold same, he's getting that feeling once again
Nothing will change tomorrowThey stumbled into their lives
In a vague way became man and wife
One got the other they deserved one another
They settled in a brand new town
With people from the same background
Kept themselves busy
Long hours left them dizzy
Now when he's in, she's out

All you ever do is fade away
All you ever do is fade away
They are not making plans
Because now they understand
All you ever do is fade away

He noticed he had visible lines
She worried about her behind
Their birth had been the death of them
It didn't really bother them
Now when she's in, he's out

All you ever do is fade away
All you ever do is fade away
She's not making plans
Because now she understand
All you ever do is fade away

When he's in, she's out

All you ever do is fade away
All you ever do is fade away
They're not making plans
Because now they understand
You must learn to forget
Cause this is all you have
All you ever do is fade away
All you ever do is fade away
All you ever do is fade away

They're not making plans
Because now they understand
All you ever do is fade away
All you ever do is fade away
All you ever do is fade awayWho met this one on the m1
Who hasn't stopped sucking his thumb
Who very straight and never grins
Who cars what car he's driving in

He is because he saw it on a commercial break
And if he doesn't get what he wants then he'll get a headache
Because he needs it, wants it, almost loves it
He's here on his own, on globe alone
Here on his own

Who joined health club to glisten
Into hi-fi precision
Who's mobile phone gives him the bone
Who very keen on Sharon Stone

He is because he saw it on a commercial break
And if he doesn't get what he wants then he'll get a headache
Because he needs it, wants it, almost loves it
He's here on his own, on globe alone

Here on his own, on globe alone

Who eats at the new brasserie
Who only ever gets Mary
Who wouldn't be seen at bedtime
Without putting Calvin Kleins on

He is because he saw it on a commercial break
And if he doesn't get what he wants then he'll get a headache
Because he needs it, wants it, almost loves it
He's here on his own, on globe alone
Here on his own, on globe alone, here on his ownMoscow's still red, the young man is dead
Gone to heaven instead, the evening news says he was confused
The motorways will all merge soon, lottery winner buys the moon
They've come to save us, the space invaders are here

He thought of cars and where, where to drive them
Who to drive them with
There, there was no-one, no-one

There's panic at london heathrow
Everybody wants to go up into the blue
But there's a ten year queue
Columbia is in top gear, it shouldn't snow at this time of year
Now america's shot gone and done the lot

He thought of planes and where, where to fly to
And who to fly there with
Where, there was no-one, no-one

He thought of cars and where, where to drive them
Who to drive them with
There, there was no-one, no-oneChurchill got his lucky number but tomorrow there's another
Could be me, could be you, no silver spoon
Sticky teeth they rot too soon
You've got to have the best tunes or that's it, you've blown it

All we want is to be happy in our homes like happy families
Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet
Yes, it could be you, ohoh oh

The likely lads are picking up the uglies
Yesterday they were just puppies
Beery slurs now life's a blur
Telly addicts
You should seem that at it
Getting in a panic
Will we be there?
Trafalgar square

All we want is to be happy in our homes like happy families
Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet
Yes, it could be you

Could be me, could be you
Could be me, could be you

Could be me, could be you
Could be me, could be you, could be you, could be you

Don't worry, if it's not your lucky number
Because tomorrow there is another
Could be you, could be me

All we want is to be happy in our homes like happy families
Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet
Yes, it could be you, ohoh ohMr. robinson and his quango
Dirty dealer, expensive car
Runs the buses and the evening star
He got a hairpiece and he got herpes
His private life is very discreet
A nicer man you're never going to meet
A self professed saviour of the dim right wing
He's got respiratory problems and a masons ring

Mr. robinson and his quango
Drinks with the general and the county wives
Yes the family business is doing all right
They are doing tangos down in the quangos
He makes them tick and he makes them tock
And if he doesn't like you he'll put you in the dock
He just sits in his leather chair and twiddles his thumbs
Gets his secretary in and pinches her bum

He ran into the toilet in the town hall
Got a biro out and he wrote on the wall
I'm wearing black french knickers on under my suit
Wearing stockings and suspenders oh I'm feeling rather loose

Oh I'm a naughty boy
Oh I'm a naughty, naughty boy

Oh I'm a naughty boy, oh I'm a naughty, naughty boy
Oh I'm a naughty boy, oh I'm a naughty, naughty boy
Oh I'm a naughty boy, oh I'm a naughty, naughty boyThe suburbs they are dreaming, they are a twinkle in her eye
She's been feeling frisky since her husband said goodbye
She wears a low cut t-shirt runs a little bmw
She's most accommodating when she's in her lingerie
Wife swapping is the future, you know that it would suit you

Yes, they're stereotypes, there must be more to life
All your life you are dreaming and then you stop dreaming
From time to time you know you should be going on another bender

The suburbs they are sleeping but she's dressing up tonight
She likes a man in uniform he loves to wear it tight
They are on the lover's sofa they are on the patio
And when the fun is over watch themselves on video
The neighbours may be staring, but they are just past caring

Yes, they're must be more to life, they're stereotypes

Wife swapping is the future, you know that it would suit youThis is the next century
Where the universal's free
You can find it anywhere
Yes, the future has been sold
Every night we're gone
And to karaoke songs
How we like to sing a long
Although the words are wrong

It really, really, really could happen
Yes, it really, really, really could happen
When the days they seem to fall through you, well just let them go

No one here is alone, satellites in every home
Yes the universal's here, here for everyone
Every paper that you read
Says tomorrow is your lucky day
Well, here's your lucky day

It really, really, really could happen
Yes, it really, really, really could happen
When the days they seem to fall through you, well just let them go

Well, it really, really, really could happen
Yes, it really, really, really could happen
When the days they seem to fall through you, well just let them go

Just let them goThis is a public warning
Be careful when you're out
We are having freaky weather
There's a lot of it about
On the terraces is it swinging
He's a monkey on the roof
You've seen him on the telly
So let me introduce you're host tonight

T.o.p.m.a.n.

T.o.p.m.a.n.
on doubles and chasers
T.o.p.m.a.n.
guilette or a razor
T.o.p.m.a.n.
shooting guns on the high street of love

In a crowd it's hard to spot him
But anonymity can cost
He's never cheap or cheerful
He's hugo and he's boss
He's riding through the desert on a camel light
And on a magic carpet he'll fly away tonight
Open sesame

T.o.p.m.a.n.

And these are the people I work with
Yuko and hiro
We work together
We work for the company
That works to the future
We work hard to please me
They will protect us

I never see you
We're never together
I'll love you forever

I drink in the evening
It helps with relaxing
I can't sleep without drinking
We drink together
From monday to saturday
I go to my workplace
But on sunday we are together
Yuko and hiro

I never see you, I never see you
We're never together, we're never together

I never see you, I never see you
We're never together, we're never together
I love you forever
