Sad drunk and poorly
Sleep in really late
Sad drunk and poorly
Not feeling so great
Wandering lost in a town full of frowns
Sad drunk and poorly
Dogs digging up the ground

[Chorus]
And I feel the light in the night and in the day
And I feel the light
When the sky's just mud and grey
And I feel the night when you tell me it's OK
Coz you're so great and I love you

Tea, tea and coffee
Helps to start the day
Tea, tea and coffee
Shaking all the way
City's alive, a surprise so am I
Tea, tea and coffee, get no sleep today
