I am the message centre
Local and direct
Room to room an operator
No calls today they'll just have to wait dear
I call and I collect
So just strike him softly away from the body

YOU'RE MADE UP TOO SHINY TODAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
THOUGHTS ARE JUST PISSING AWAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)

I am a manager
I am in control
As the local delegator
No calls today dear they'll just have to wait dear
I offer no guarantee at all
So don't take it lightly you'll put yourself under

YOU'RE MADE UP TOO SHINY TODAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
THOUGHTS ARE JUST PISSING AWAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
A NEW TYPE FACE AND NEW DAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER TEN MINUTES AGO (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE

YOU'RE MADE UP TOO SHINY TODAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
THOUGHTS ARE JUST PISSING AWAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
A NEW TYPE FACE AND NEW DAY (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER TEN MINUTES AGO (IN SO MUCH TROUBLE)
IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE
