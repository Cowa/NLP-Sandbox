So far I've not really stayed in touch
Well you knew as much it's no surprise that today
I'll get up early too from a lack of anything to do

AND I MIGHT AS WELL JUST GRIN AND BEAR IT
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE OF AN ARGUMENT

And you have not really stayed in touch
Well I knew as much it's no surprise that today
I get up for round two with nothing to do
Except get a touch of flu

AND I MIGHT AS WELL GRIN AND BEAR IT
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE OF AN ARGUMENT
AND IN ANY CASE I'D RATHER WEAR IT
IT'S LIKE A BADHEAD IN THE MORNING

And I know

AND I MIGHT AS WELL GRIN AND BEAR IT
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE OF AN ARGUMENT
AND IN ANY CASE I'D RATHER WEAR IT
IT'S LIKE A BADHEAD IN THE MORNING
