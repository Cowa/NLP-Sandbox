A malady has taken him over
Coughing tar in his japanese motor
The lights are magic
And he feels lucky
And he's got money
Shoots like an arrow - oh

LONDON LOVES
THE MYSTERY OF A SPEEDING CAR
LONDON LOVES
THE MISERY OF A SPEEDING HEART

Its love u like, and everyone's at it
And words are cheap when the mind is elastic
He loves the violence
Keeps ticking over
So sleep together
Before today is sold forever

LONDON LOVES
THE WAY PEOPLE JUST FALL APART
LONDON LOVES
THE WAY YOU JUST DON'T STAND A CHANCE
LONDON LOVES
THE MYSTERY OF A SPEEDING CAR

O-OH O-OH O-OH O-OH
