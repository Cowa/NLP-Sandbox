Walking on sand on my home high noon 
In love with the moon, love you

When you see me
Please turn your back and walk away
I don't want to see you 
Cos i know the dreams that you keep is wearing me
When your coming down, think of me here
I got no distance left to run

It's over, I knew it would end this way
I hope you're with someone who makes you feel
That this life is the night
And it settles down, stays around
Spends more time with you

VIP 223
Have my chances
They have me
Now stay up nights
Watch TV
I'm a country sad
I'm a ballad man

I'm on a come back roll
Yeah I'm a bizzard
And in my motor home
Sweat on my pillow all nightI remember thinking murder in the car
Watching dogs somersault
Through sprinkles on tiny laws
I remember the graffti, we are your children
Coming in with spray cans of paint
I remember the sunset and the plains of cement
And the way the nights seems to turn the colour
of orangeade

In this town cellular phones are hot with thieves
In this town we all go to terminal pubs
It helps us sweat out those angry bits of life
From this town the English Army grind
Their teeth to glass
You'll get kicked tonight
Smell of puke and piss
Smell of puke and piss on your stillettoes

Here comes the panic attack
My heart stops then starts
Give me a drink
I'll drink your round
I'll take you round the pole
It's cold up here
You'll catch the flu or you'll catch the city
Either way, you'll catch the flu
Or you'll catch the cityI heard a man who had no lungs
he took me in and made me lunch
He told me how I'd lost my friend
He smiled at me it was the end
I said

I'm just a killer for your love

I cut my hair off in the road
I take my coat off dropped my load
I wipe my hands on the grass
Coz I know that nothing ever lasts
And I said

I'm just a killer for your loveGood morning lethargy
Drink pepsi is good for energy
The bath's on, smoke in the bedroom
Sore throat and on my neck a nasty bruise
Where it came from, well I don't know
We played last night, it was a good show

Got the play out, second rate chatshow
It's a nation wide deal, so you gotta go
Chuck from the company says it will be alright
Got an ad on KROQ
And there's an in-store tonight
Well I build things up
Then I let them go
Got to get time share on the radio

Look inside America, she's alright, she's alright
Sitting out the distance
But I'm not trying to make her mine
Looking for America
With its kooky nights and suicide
Where the TV says it's alright
Coz' everybody's hung up on something or other

Steppin' off in 20, so the driver says
I should sleep tonight
But I think I'll watch videos instead
Annie Hall leaves NY in the end
Press rewind and Woody gets her back again
And the whole world could pass through me
But I don't know if it means much to me

Look inside America
She's alright, she's alright
Sitting out the distance
But I'm not trying to make her mine
Looking for America
With its kooky nights and suicide
Where the TV says it's alright
Coz everybody's strung out on something or other

And the whole world 
Could pass through me
But I don't know if it means much to meIt's automatic
I need to unload
Under the pressure
Gone middle of the road
Fall into fashion
Fall out again
We stick together
Cause it never ends

Here comes a low
I'm a boy and you're a girl
Here comes a high
The only ones in the world
Here comes everything
You and me can work it out
Here it comes
You, me, we'll work it out!

Here comes tomorrow
1 2 3 episodes
We stick together
Gone middle of the road
Cause that's entertainment
It's the sound of the wheel
It rolls on forever
You know how good it feels

Here comes a low
I'm a boy and you're a girl
Here comes a high
The only ones that's in the world
Here comes everything
We're like monkeys out in the space
Here it comes
We are members of the human race
You, me, we'll work it out!

It's automatic
I need to unload
Under the pressure
Gone middle of the road
Fall into fashion
Fall out again

You're the only one that's in the world

I met the gourmet man
With aluminium lungs
Sucks all we can

Seek the whole world go flip
In a stunt bug style
With a cellulite pile
But he can smile

This is the music
And we're movin' on, movin' on

We're sticky eyes and sticky bones
You get no time on your own
You get a dose and get a ghost
You get it coast to coast
Dye your hair black
Get Satan tattoed on your back
Pierce yourself with a coke can
Put yourself in fake tan now you're in a band

Coz this is the music
And we're movin' on, movin' on
Hey, this is the music
And we're movin' on, movin' on
No matter how low, there's always further to go
We're movin' on, movin' on

We're movin' on, it won't be long
We're movin' on, it won't be longHoly man tiptoed his way across the Ganges
The sound of magic music in his ears
Videoded by a bus load of touristis
Shinny shellsuits and drinking lemonade
Now I got a funny feeling
Which I bought mailorder
From a man in a teepee in California
Said he once was a great game show performer
Then he blew all his money away
Blew it all away

So take me home
Don't leave alone
I'm not that good 
But I'm not that bad
No psycho killer
Hooligan gorilla
I dream to riot
Oh you should try it
I'll eat parole get gold card soul
My joy of life is on a roll
And we'll all be the same in the end

Then you're on your own

Well we go happy day glow in the discos
The sound of magic music in our brains
Someone stumbles to the bathroom
with the horrors
Says lord give me time for I've jumped into space
I'm in outter spaceI got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is 
No

Woo-hoo
When I feel heavy-metal
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Well, I lie and I'm easy
All the time but I am never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head down
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Oh yeahAll I want to be is washed out by the sea
No death star over me
Won't give me any peace
All I want is light relief
Put the crazies on the street
Give them guns and feed them meat
Now shoot the death star down
Dig a hole and put it down
Thousand miles undergroung

They say it's no game 
There's strange news from another star
I'm lost, I'm lost
There's strange news from another star

Give me all your stuff
Until I can't get up
Watch the whole world freeze
Countig tin can in our sleep
I don't believe in me
I don't believe in me
All I've ever done is tame
Will you love me all the same
Will you love me though
Always the sameSad drunk and poorly
Sleep in really late
Sad drunk and poorly
Not feeling so great
Wandering lost in a town full of frowns
Sad drunk and poorly
Dogs digging up the ground

And I feel the light in the night and in the day
And I feel the light
When the sky's just mud and grey
And I feel the night when you tell me it's OK
Coz you're so great and I love you

Tea, tea and coffee
Helps to start the day
Tea, tea and coffee
Shaking all the way
City's alive, a surprise so am I
Tea, tea and coffee, get no sleep today
So far I've not really stayed in touch
Well you knew as much it's no surprise that today
I'll get up early too from a lack of anything to do

AND I MIGHT AS WELL JUST GRIN AND BEAR IT
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE OF AN ARGUMENT

And you have not really stayed in touch
Well I knew as much it's no surprise that today
I get up for round two with nothing to do
Except get a touch of flu

AND I MIGHT AS WELL GRIN AND BEAR IT
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE OF AN ARGUMENT
AND IN ANY CASE I'D RATHER WEAR IT
IT'S LIKE A BADHEAD IN THE MORNING

And I know

AND I MIGHT AS WELL GRIN AND BEAR IT
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE OF AN ARGUMENT
AND IN ANY CASE I'D RATHER WEAR IT
IT'S LIKE A BADHEAD IN THE MORNINGGrandma has got new dentures
To eat the crust on pizza
Been taken out by her daughter
Because she thought she ought'a
The kids are eating snickers
Because they're so delicious
Then there's sticky f1ngers
And mother looses her knickers

DAYS OF ENJOYMENT TO WHICH EVERYONE CHEERS

Bank holidayI'm on the white cliffs of Dover
Thinking it over and over
But if I jump its all over
A cautionary tale for you
I'd like to roll in the clover
With you over and over
On the white cliffs of dover
And then I'd let you push me over

AND IF THAT IS THE FACT THEN IN ACTUAL FACT IT'S NOT WHERE IT'S AT
AND IT'S OVER

AND IT'S OVER

And now the bluebirds are over
Over the white cliffs of dover
So when you push me over
Don't bury me I'm not worth anythingShe said there's ants in the carpet
Dirty little monsters
Eating all the morsels
Picking up the rubbish
Give her effervescence
She needs a little sparkle
Good morning tv
You're looking so healthy

And we all say
Don't want to be alone
We wear the same clothes
Because we feel the same
And kiss with dry lips
When we say goodnight
End of the century... it's nothing special

Sex on tv
Everybody's at it
And the mind gets dirty

They're glowing in a huddle

And you know that
