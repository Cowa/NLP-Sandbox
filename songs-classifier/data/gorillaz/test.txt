The mountains are waiting
The full moon has come

I got lost on the highway
But don't ask me where I've been
Or what I've done

Oh lord send me transmissions
Forgive me for what I've become

The sun has come to save me
Put a little love into my
Lonely soul

The sun has come to save me
Put a little love into my
Lonely soul

Well don't you know why
You need her loving you?

Float inside...Let's talk about Phoenix
It's got a way
Of helping you to breathe a little better

Through the storm and rain
If you need to escape
Oh you wonder why

Let's talk about Phoenix
It's got a way
Of helping you to breathe a little better

I can slowly see
A light faded away
In my mind and in my heart I have no doubt
Oh you wonder whyDrive away,
As in lonesome south
Like a real straight-shooter
Three lanes full

Drive away,
As in lonesome south
Like a real straight-shooter
Three lanes full

Gotta ride in my heart
Get em going down,
You don't have to be a start,
To, to get them going round

Even if you try to move,
Wheel it to your right,
So get on, on the driving wheel,
Save it for a round,

Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly Man now

Got a ride in my heart
See I'm going down
Cut up by the ball front,
Shoot a jamboree,
Just a cold lighted day,
Like a memory,
Just a cold lighted day,
Slip a line on me,

Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly Man nowThey're just little pink plastic bags
blowing on the highway alone
they don't know where they'll go
they just gonna float out
hoh oh oho ohRevolving doors what have I done
Someone on the TV attempting love
Revolving doors what will I become
A redneck song

Paid up for seven
But he only got an eight now, now
I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
I see no wronging

On a foggy day
Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston
Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston...
I sit in a diner
And the Beatles play

I'm paid up for a seven
But I only got s.o-eight oh now

Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston...
I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
I seem to run out here

Revolving doors
It's stormy on the eastern sea board
He got silver up his night

He paid up for three
But got only two

Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston
Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston...

Then he said
Seems I was born for this
Seems I was born to this
Revolving doors
Revolving doorsFriday
She found out

The pride needs to cool little rain didn't do it
Never got it back from you
Driveway
You can bring a fool remember
You can ride away
Never gonna get back there

There's red light in the moonlight baby
That's all, I'm moving on from you
You can try to leave me or doubt me
Oh I'm the coolest still, right now

I'd never say goodbye little baby
Never againColorful sailors washed up on the shore
caught up on bad times
Spider in the ditch she saw it all
Went to train, ride to dance
Colorful sailors washed up on the shore
met up on violence

Spider in the ditch she saw it all.
World has fall on bad times
Texas can you hear me?
Speed up on the dawn.
To the plains and blues of Houston
in the sun.

Where home is a rust
in the parish of space dust
Where the mountains die,
and today is golden.Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Some kind of metal made up from glue
Some kind of plastic I could wrap around you
They need the eat, and they-they wear phony clothes

Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Well near thy plastics
And digital foils
Could wrap up the sun
And protect the girls
From the spiritual poisons
You spill at night
Like phony clothes, but
I really like my-

Some kind of nature (some kind of nature, some kind of soul)
Comes from one within us
Oh, Lord, forgive me (some kind of mixture, some kind of gold)
It's got to come and find us
All we are is dust

And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

Oh Stylo... (juice)
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is right
Electric is the love
When the mako flies (a giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies, not so broken hearted (from the end of the line)

Yes, this love is electric
It'll be flowing on the street
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now

Sing yourself (juice)
Out of depression, rise above
I'll be searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love

There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passin through man and woman
In another world
In another world, in the universe
Right now
Here's what we got to do
Yes, this love is electric
It'll be flowing onto the street
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard

That's what I'm talking about

Right nowThis morning you've got time for a hot, home-cooked breakfast
Delicious and piping hot in only 3 microwave minutes.

Yo, pretty packages of frosted delights
Look, it comes with a toy hehe, I like that.
I wanna number 4, a number 6, and throw in a plastic doughnut
Just enjoy the gritty crunch, it tastes just like chicken.
Wrappers of many bit sizes
Man, are you freakin blind? That's a rock.
All mixed in the pot for momma's homemade from scratch, well, not quite.
Toasted over flames, they be tasting quite right.

All hail king Neptune and his water breathers

Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut these chains in half and all I want is
Someone to rely on as
Thunder comes a rolling down
Someone to rely on as
Lightning comes a staring in again

I'll wait to be forgiven
Maybe I never will
My star has left me
To take the bitter pill
That shattered feeling
Well the cause of it's a lesson learned
Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
"Just don't know if I could do it all again" she said, it's true

Waiting in my room and I lock the door
I watch the coloured animals across the floor
And I'm looking from a distance
And I'm listening to the whispers
And oh it ain't the same, when you're falling out of feeling and you're
Falling in and caught again

I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side, but are you still with me?
The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry but you're feeling it
But I just have to tell that I love you so much these days
Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true

My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Caught again

My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Caught againGorillaz and the boss Dogg
Planet of the apes

The revolution will be televised
And the pollution from the ocean
Now with devotion
Push peace and keep it in motion

Kids, gather around
Yeah, I need your focus
I know it seems like the world is so hopeless

It's like wonderland

Now fascinate me
Picture and animate me
'Cause I'm rollin'
Deep holein'
Click clacking
Crack-a-lacking
Full packing
Mo' stacking
Acting a fool when I teach
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach

Mirror mirror on the wall
Boss Dawg
Give it to 'em
Get involved
Turn it up
Speed it up
Slow it up
Underground where the under us undercut
Shipped up
Shipped out
Swimmin' with the sharks
Put my gills up
Turn the wheels up
Real tough
Drinkin' lemonade in the shade
Getting blade with a gang of prilgrims

Yeah, just like that
Belly floppin' lockin' while I'm rockin' in the bubble bath
And I'm just like math
Fozo's added up that get you more cash
So quick, so fast
All the kids say they love it when I make 'em laugh

Welcome to the world of the Plastic BeachHey
Look
Yo!
No castaway, no survivor
I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
and mommy ain't said 'Honey, I shrunk the kids' yet.
I ain't Jesus, but i'm walkin' on water.
There's no bums here, there's no wall cause:
I can break out of jail with a lighter,
so is there any point in makin' laws blood?
This ain't Atlantis, are you sure?
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore.
No rain, condoms it poured and up the road
never guess who I saw.

It's K.A. look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym.
Honey, I'm home. This is where I wanna live.
Just found it like Nemo
on the d-low.
I don't know if it's greener, but it's green though:
on the other side of the fence.
Bind to the ends.
Look:
No fence, no stress, no rent, no superficial shit, 
this real flow.
Where the women look hot, but the beach cold,
and the speech goes like, "Hi little lady."
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby.
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy.
Swag up on a hundred degrees, not eighty.
Look, if heaven had a VIP
this is it: white sand, blue sea,
but I don't know who they are,
and I'm damn sure they don't know me,
but I come in peace!

Cool! White Flag! White Flag!
No War!
No Guns!
No Corps!
Just life.
Just Love
No Hype. 
Just fun.
No ties.
Just me and my mind.
Just me and my wife.
But tell me if I'm dreamin'
'cause I don't wanna wake up till the evenin'
and I don't wanna be left sleepin'
from all the diseases
that I breathe in.
Look, respect the island, no stealin'!
and don't bring religion here, no free kings. 
Integrate and then we ain't leavin'! 
We come on in peace. Sing!
White flag?
White flag!
