All alone...

Leviticus
Deuteronomy

Snatch a piece of my wondering
This did fall like under in
Skid em with two lights
Skid em with boot light
Fly in my soup like
Where's the waitress
Can't take this really can't finish this
These airs and all these graces
It's my mistake I'll make it
J'd up to the boom now make it
Bounce wiggle bounce wiggle shaking all them things out
Chemical cutthroats 'bout to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain
This ain't no game
I'll show no shame
I'll birth this bane
I'll twist the game
I'll twist the game
I'll push this plane
It's plain as day
Known to what these sayers say
Known to what these doers do
It's you and who and you know where
We's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear
We're happy and we lonesome
The lone drum the beat hot
From start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach
The soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth over
We turn up the 'oh God'

All alone...

Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be
Come and save the night
Coz I don't leave
When the morning comes it doesn't
Seem to say an awful lot to me...

All alone...It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's DARE

It's DARE

You've got to press it on you
You just think it
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, DARE

Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out

Never did no harm
Never did no harm

It's DARE
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's DARE

It's DARE

You've got to press it on you
You just, think it, that's what you do
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, DARE

Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out

Never did no harm
Never did no harm

It's DARE
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's DARE

Never did no harm
Never did no harm

It's DARE
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's coming up
It's DARE

You've got to press it on you
You just, think it, that's what you do
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, DARE

Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out

You've got to press it on you
You just, think it, that's what you do
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, DARE

Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it outIn demon days, it's cold inside
You don't get nobody, people sigh
It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
Hiding in a hole in there
All the glasses are too big
Bring it back, got to hold it back
To let you do that yet you don't want me back
Before it fall down, falling down falling down
Falling out to go far from the soul (ah)

In these demon days
It's so cold inside
So hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
Because mother earth wants us all to leave
When lies become reality
You numb yourself with drugs and T.V.
So pick yourself up, it's a brand new day
So turn yourself round
Don't burn yourself, turn youself
Turn yourself around
To the sun!

To the sun, to the sun...
To the sun, to the sun...I need a gun to keep myself from harm
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance
They ain't got a chance
I need a gun
'Cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

I need a gun to keep myself from harm
The poor people are burning in the sun
But they ain't got a chance
They ain't got a chance
I need a gun
'Cause all I do is dance
'Cause all I do is dance

In my backpack
I got my act right
In case you act quite difficult
And your resolve weaken
With anger and discontent
Some are seeking and searching like Nimoy

I'm a peace-loving decoy
Ready for retaliation
I change the whole occasion to a pine box six-under
Impulsive don't ask why or wonder
Orders given to me is:
strike and I'm thunder with lightning fast reflexes on constant alert
from the constant hurt that seems limitless with no dropping pressure

Seems like everybody's out to test ya
'Til they see your break
You can't conceal the hate
That consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu

Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a 90 days visit
And I'm filled with guilt
From things that I've seen
Your water's from a bottle
mine's from a canteen

At night I hear the shots
Ring so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life,
it seems to get cheaper
out in the desert
with my street sweeper
The war is over
So said the speaker with the flight suit on
Maybe to him I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance
Man, all I want to do is dance

(Dance!)
(Dance!)
(Dance!)

I need a gun to keep myself from harmGot off a plane to the countryside,
I drove to the mountain and holding the ground
There was crack on the corner and someone dead,
and fire coming out of the monkey's head

Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
you'll make a big mistake

Put me in a cab to suburbia
I just took a line but it wasn't with you
There was more of it there, when I got back home
But you'd left me, you don't know my soul...
You're a hoe girl
Yeah you're a hoe

Aaaah...Summer don't know me no more
Eager man, that's all

Summer don't know me no more
He just let me love in myself
'Cause I do know, Lord,
from you that
Just died, yeah

I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

Don't stop the buck when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see

Money won't get there
Ten years passed tonight
You'll flee

If you do that,
I'll be someone
To find you

I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mineI lost my leg like I lost my way
So no loose ends
Nothing to see me down
How are we going to work this out?

Dreams aren't bad, I had turned back
I love the girl
But God only knows it's
Getting hard to see the sun coming through
I love you...
But what are we going to do?

Picture I'm a dreamer
I'll take you deeper
Down to the sleepy glow
Time is a low..
Don't you know?
What are we going to do?

When you go back
All the second selfless days
You're in love with him
I want to see you again
I love you...
But what are we going to do?Hahahahahahahahaha,
Feel good,
Feel good,
Feel good,
Feel good,
Feel good,
Feel good,
Feel good,
Feel good,
Feel good...

City's breaking down on a camel's back.
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free
You've got a new horizon it's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they've got to kiss me 'cause I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is sinking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats,
Lining them up like ass cracks,
Lay these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack.
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear reppin' it harder this year
Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahahaa.

Yo, we gonna go ghost town,
This motown,
With your sound
You're in the blink
Gonna bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With your sound
You kill the INC.
So don't stop, get it, get it
Until you cheddar head it.
Yo, watch the way I navigate
Hahahahahhaa

Feel good, ahhhhahahahah

Don't stop, shit it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady,
Watch me navigate,
Ahahahahahhaa.
Don't stop, shit it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady,
Watch me navigate
Ahahahahahhaa.

Feel good, ahhhhahahahaha
Feel good,
Feel good, ahhhhahahahaha
Feel good...Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain,
there was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived,
their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world,
obscured as it was by great clouds.
Here they played out their peaceful lives,
innocent of the litany of excess and violence that was growing in the world below.
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough.
Then one day Strangefolk arrived in the town.
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses, but no one noticed them: they only saw shadows.
You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind.

Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing the dance of the dead,
the dance of the dead,
the dance of the dead

In time, Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain,
and it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable Sincerity and Beauty.
By chance, they stumbled upon the Place Where All Good Souls Come to Rest.
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things,
and soon they began to mine the mountain, its rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world.
Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly,
their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls.
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain.
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain,
holes began to appear, bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the monkey.
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful for they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep.
And then came a sound. Distant first, it grew into castrophany so immense it could be heard far away in space.
There were no screams. There was no time.
The mountain called Monkey had spoken.
There was only fire.
And then, nothing.

O little town in U.S.A, your time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you want
But where were you when it all came down on me?
Did you call me now?Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Taking over
But it won't be long
They're mesmerized
Skeletons
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say no to

Drinking out (is she real, is she)
Pacifier (is she real, is she)
Vitamin souls (is she real, is she)
The street desire (is she real, is she)
Doesn't make sense to (is she real, is she)
But it won't be long (is she real, is she)
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say no to

And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire
It's all desire

Drinking out
Pacifier
Sinking soul
There you are
Doesn't make side to
But it won't be long
Cause kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say no to

And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire

Is she, is she real, is she
Is she real, is she (it's real)
Is she, is she real, is she
Is she real, is she (it's real)

Is she is she realAre we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

Take a gun
Or how you say
That's no way you behave

Just a law, a new begin
Sing a song that doesn't sin
And it grows
Hey, you know

Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last to get away to some another day?
Do we know
Well, we know
Doesn't seem to be complete

Are we, are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

Get up, get up, get up, get up...

What you say?
Cause all I was on
I got it down wrong
I see myself to get
And the Lord, seeing all now
Can you take us in
The part that comin' on
The coldest man doesn't see it's all

We go to the car
I see you walk to the far
And when you get there do you see
You fit the last you need on me

Cause we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
Yeah, we're the last living souls
We're the last living soulsSlow it down some
No split clown
Bum, your old hit sound dumb
Hold it now, crown 'im
Where you found them at
Got 'em 'round town
Coulda drowned in it
Woulda floated bloated
Voted sugar coated
Loaded hip shooter
Draw for the poor
Free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw
None more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw
That dank sure stank lit
Sank passed the pit for more hardcore prank spit
Crank it on blast
Roll past front street
Blew the whole spot
Like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast
Juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

Something's starting today
Where did he go? why you wanted to be?
Well you know, november has come
When it's gone away..

(baha) Can you dig it like a spigot
My guess is yes you can like, can I kick it? wicked
Liquor shot
If u happy and u know it
As you clap your hands to the thick snot of a poet flow it
Broke a pen and i'm in cope hymen
Dope or rhymin all worth it then
The hope diamond
Required off the blackmarket
Or wire tappin
Couldn't target a jar of spit
The rapid fire spark lit
zzzzt!
A rapper bug zapper
And it don't matter after if they's a thug or a dapper.
Plug yer trap or it's maximum exposure
The beast got family in numbers asking 'em for closure
Aw, send 'em a gun an tell em clean it
Then go get the nun who said her son didn't mean it
She wore a filled-in thong
A billabong
And said, nah, fo'realla
The Villain on a Gorilla jawn?O green world,
Don't desert me now
Bring me back to fallen town
Where someone is still alive

Fighting for something new in this
When no one needs the heart of me and I'll
Get out somewhere other than me before...

(than me before...)

O green world
Don't deserve me now
I'm made of you and you of me
But where are we?
Oh no

Sells to lie
Phone with talk, you stars
Suppose you
Down when you're in fast
Cause it seems so little to you

But now you're in love, you know
You know, me too
You know, me too
I hope sex and drugs rust into my self, holy
It feels holy
It feels like you're with your father in the place you love...White light
White light
White light
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, white lightThe world is spinning too fast
I'm buying Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I try to lose

My mama said to slow down
You must make my own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

Keep a my groove on

Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!

(There's a-)

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapour trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between it's brain and his tail

And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose

Keep a my groove on

Ba ba ba
Bay do de bop

OK bring it down yeah we gonna break out

I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

Yeah... Ha Ha!
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe.
Spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless
To those the definition for what life is
Priceless
To you because I put you on the high shit
You like it?
Gun smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among those
Possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

The essence the basics
Without did you make it
Allow me to make this
Child-like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My futureAll of which makes me anxious

Wallflowers
Giving no action no
All hours we chillin' and max the flow
Relaxing
Opposites attracting
I'ma toss my hat in
Floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack bend
Jigging and wiggling
Freakin' booties speakin' to the cuties so belligerent
No religion just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn
Negativity we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it respawns

(Da da da da da da da da)
Distant stars
Come in black or red
I've seen their worlds
Inside my head

They connect 
With the fall of man
They breathe you in
And dive as deep as they can

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising

There's nothing you can say to him
He is an outer heart
And the space has been broken

Broken
Our love
Broken

Is it far away in the 
Glitter Freeze
Or in our eyes
Every time they leave

It's by the light
Of the plasma screens
We keep switched on
All through the night while we sleep

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising

There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart
And the space has been broken

Broken
Our love
BrokenOn the cloud of unknowing
My world seems open
Every satellite up here is watching
But I was here from the very start
Trying to find a way to your heart

All the days are forgetting
They've gone out with the tide
Lost at sea somewhere, waiting
Like setting suns at the rodeo
Trying to find someone you'll never know

Oh, sinking love
On the cloud of unknowing
Every satellite up here is wanting
Waiting to see what the morning brings
May bring sunshine on its wings
Oh joys are us
The sun has come again to hold you
Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prayer is here,
It's all around you
It's all around you out here

And if the whole world is crashing down on you
Fall through space out of mind with me
Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Blows all the shadows far away

The falling of the whole empire is here to hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sleeps

Little memories marching on
Your little feet working the machine
Say will it spin, will it soar
My little dream working the machine

Soon like a wave that pass will fall
And closing in on you they're going on

Little memories
Your little feet working the machine
Say will it spin, will it soar
My little dream working the machine

Soon like a wave that pass will fall
And closing in on you they're going onWhere's North from here?

It was a glitter freeze
Listen
You are a credit
A believer

Ship him far!Up on melancholy hill
There's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day of another dream

Well, you can't get what you want but you can get me
So let's set out to sea, love
'Cause you are my medicine
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

So call in the submarine
'Round the world we'll go
Does anybody know her?
If we're looking out on the day of another dream

If you can't get what you want then you come with me

Up on melancholy hill sits a manatee
Just looking out for the day
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

When you're close to me
Its all good news now
Because we left the taps
Running 
For a hundred years
So drink into the drink

A plastic cup of drink
Drink with a couple
of people
The plastic creating people

Still connected 
to the moment
it beganTo the dark, dark seas,
Comes the only whale.
Watching ships go by,
It's the daily troll, oh yes

It doesn't know that,

It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's Automated computer speech
It's Automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio...

If they haul you out,
On a really hot day
When the call got made,
You had gone away, from...

It doesn't know...

It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's Automated computer speech
It's Automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio...

Plastic, yo
Plastic, yo
Plastic, yo
Green, green dough

It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's Automated computer speech
It's Automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio...I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines 'til they weep
With future pixels in factories far away

So call the mainland from the beach
All parties now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

Uh
mmmmMMMMMMMmmmmm...

I got a feeling now my heart is frozen
All the verses and the corrosion
Have been after native in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yeah, clinging to the atoms of rocks
Seasons, the adjustments, signs of change
I can't see now she said taxi
Now red light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties, and skies

I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Uh
(That's electric)

Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time everyday, same routine
Clear target in the summer when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away
(Here we go again)
(That's electric)

Your love's like rhinestones, falling from the sky
(That's electric)
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)
(That's electric)
Your love's like rhinestones, falling from the sky
(That's electric)
With future pixels in factories far away (Here we go again)
