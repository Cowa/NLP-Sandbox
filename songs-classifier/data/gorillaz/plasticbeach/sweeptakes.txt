Pay day, you're a winner

Pay day, you're a winner
Keep cool form a line
Scar'd money broke money
Bow money mo' money
So sunny, cloud breaker
Sound make a wave run-up
While motherfuckin' jammin'
You can get it how you wanna

There's math and there's dealers and players and me
They say that they're winners
Ok well let's see
You play there you play
The rules of the trade
The math of the date
The times and the age
But you want how you like
Aim high man why not?
Sun Moon and Starry y'alls
Each and all of y'alls
Mathematics and dealers and players and me
They say that they're winners
Ok well let's see...

Sweepstakes! You're a winner

Pay day, you're a winner

Every player 'Yeah me'

Player play! hey ok
