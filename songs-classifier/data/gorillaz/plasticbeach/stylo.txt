Love, electricity, shockwave central
Pummel on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep it all together
Yes the lantern burn, burn it easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the
Overload, overload, overload
Comin' up to the

Oh Stylo... (juice)
Go forth, blossom in your soul
When you know your heart is right
Electric is the love
When the mako flies (a giant fish)
Up from the bottom in your eyes
Then I know the twilight skies, not so broken hearted (from the end of the line)

Yes, this love is electric
It'll be flowing on the street
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard
Right now

Sing yourself (juice)
Out of depression, rise above
I'll be searching if I know your heart
Electric is the love

There's only one way
Let it pray a little while longer
It's got a way of passin through man and woman
In another world
In another world, in the universe
Right now
Here's what we got to do
Yes, this love is electric
It'll be flowing onto the street
Night after night
Just to get through the week
Sometimes it's hard

That's what I'm talking about
Love, electricity, shockwave central
Pummel on the motherboard, yes
Push up, overload, legendary heavy glow
Sunshine, thunder roll, keep it all together
Yes the lantern burn, burn that easy
And broadcast, so raw and neatly
Thunder roll, sunshine, work it out

Right now
