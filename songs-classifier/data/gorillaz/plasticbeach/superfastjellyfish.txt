This morning you've got time for a hot, home-cooked breakfast
Delicious and piping hot in only 3 microwave minutes.

Yo, pretty packages of frosted delights
Look, it comes with a toy hehe, I like that.
I wanna number 4, a number 6, and throw in a plastic doughnut
Just enjoy the gritty crunch, it tastes just like chicken.
Wrappers of many bit sizes
Man, are you freakin blind? That's a rock.
All mixed in the pot for momma's homemade from scratch, well, not quite.
Toasted over flames, they be tasting quite right.

All hail king Neptune and his water breathers
No snail thing to quick for his water feeders 
Don't waste time with your net, our net worth is Set Ready, go. 
Many know others, but 
we be the colors of the mad and the wicked
we be bad, we be brickit with the 24 hour sign
shower my habits while you dine like rabbits
with the crunchy, crunchy carrots (that's chicken)
Gotta have it Superfast!

(A whole lot of breakfast you got time for!)

Superfast Superfast, I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep it through, Keep it through, forever blue 
Tonight's the night for action
Aluminum I crush your f.u.n aluminum
The sea is radioactive 
The sea is radioactive
