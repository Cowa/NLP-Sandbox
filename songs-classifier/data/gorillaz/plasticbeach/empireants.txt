Oh joys are us
The sun has come again to hold you
Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prayer is here,
It's all around you
It's all around you out here

And if the whole world is crashing down on you
Fall through space out of mind with me
Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Blows all the shadows far away

The falling of the whole empire is here to hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sleeps

Little memories marching on
Your little feet working the machine
Say will it spin, will it soar
My little dream working the machine

Soon like a wave that pass will fall
And closing in on you they're going on

Little memories
Your little feet working the machine
Say will it spin, will it soar
My little dream working the machine

Soon like a wave that pass will fall
And closing in on you they're going on
