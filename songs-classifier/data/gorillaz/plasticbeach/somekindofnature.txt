Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Some kind of metal made up from glue
Some kind of plastic I could wrap around you
They need the eat, and they-they wear phony clothes

Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Well near thy plastics
And digital foils
Could wrap up the sun
And protect the girls
From the spiritual poisons
You spill at night
Like phony clothes, but
I really like my-

Some kind of nature (some kind of nature, some kind of soul)
Comes from one within us
Oh, Lord, forgive me (some kind of mixture, some kind of gold)
It's got to come and find us
All we are is dust

Some kind of metal made up from glue
Some kind of plastic I could wrap around you
They need the eat, and they-they wear phony clothes

Some kind of nature (some kind of nature, some kind of soul)
Comes from one within us
Oh, Lord, forgive me (some kind of mixture, some kind of gold)
It's got to come and find us
All we are is dust
