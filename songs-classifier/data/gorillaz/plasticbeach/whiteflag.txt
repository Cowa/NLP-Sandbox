Hey
Look
Yo!
No castaway, no survivor
I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
and mommy ain't said 'Honey, I shrunk the kids' yet.
I ain't Jesus, but i'm walkin' on water.
There's no bums here, there's no wall cause:
I can break out of jail with a lighter,
so is there any point in makin' laws blood?
This ain't Atlantis, are you sure?
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore.
No rain, condoms it poured and up the road
never guess who I saw.

It's K.A. look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym.
Honey, I'm home. This is where I wanna live.
Just found it like Nemo
on the d-low.
I don't know if it's greener, but it's green though:
on the other side of the fence.
Bind to the ends.
Look:
No fence, no stress, no rent, no superficial shit, 
this real flow.
Where the women look hot, but the beach cold,
and the speech goes like, "Hi little lady."
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby.
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy.
Swag up on a hundred degrees, not eighty.
Look, if heaven had a VIP
this is it: white sand, blue sea,
but I don't know who they are,
and I'm damn sure they don't know me,
but I come in peace!

Cool! White Flag! White Flag!
No War!
No Guns!
No Corps!
Just life.
Just Love
No Hype. 
Just fun.
No ties.
Just me and my mind.
Just me and my wife.
But tell me if I'm dreamin'
'cause I don't wanna wake up till the evenin'
and I don't wanna be left sleepin'
from all the diseases
that I breathe in.
Look, respect the island, no stealin'!
and don't bring religion here, no free kings. 
Integrate and then we ain't leavin'! 
We come on in peace. Sing!
White flag?
White flag!
