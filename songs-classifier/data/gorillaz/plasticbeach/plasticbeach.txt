To the dark, dark seas,
Comes the only whale.
Watching ships go by,
It's the daily troll, oh yes

It doesn't know that,

It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's Automated computer speech
It's Automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio...

If they haul you out,
On a really hot day
When the call got made,
You had gone away, from...

It doesn't know...

It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's Automated computer speech
It's Automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio...

Plastic, yo
Plastic, yo
Plastic, yo
Green, green dough

It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's a styrofoam deepsea landfill
It's Automated computer speech
It's Automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a Casio...
