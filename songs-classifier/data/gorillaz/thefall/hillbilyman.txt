Drive away,
As in lonesome south
Like a real straight-shooter
Three lanes full

Drive away,
As in lonesome south
Like a real straight-shooter
Three lanes full

Gotta ride in my heart
Get em going down,
You don't have to be a start,
To, to get them going round

Even if you try to move,
Wheel it to your right,
So get on, on the driving wheel,
Save it for a round,

Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly Man now

Got a ride in my heart
See I'm going down
Cut up by the ball front,
Shoot a jamboree,
Just a cold lighted day,
Like a memory,
Just a cold lighted day,
Slip a line on me,

Hillbilly, Hillbilly, Hillbilly Man now
