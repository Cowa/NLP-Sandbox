The mountains are waiting
The full moon has come

I got lost on the highway
But don't ask me where I've been
Or what I've done

Oh lord send me transmissions
Forgive me for what I've become

The sun has come to save me
Put a little love into my
Lonely soul

The sun has come to save me
Put a little love into my
Lonely soul

Well don't you know why
You need her loving you?

Float inside...
