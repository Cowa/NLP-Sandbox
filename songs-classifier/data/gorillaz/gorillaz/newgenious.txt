dream of my world
i live on my world
going off my head, down to, somewhere
i'm going on a dance all tune

in a pressure today
i blew a bad man away, today
higher ground, had to be told
i blew a man away

brother, sister too
do what you must do
don't trust people you meet
they might promise you
that the river ain't deep

dream on the street
people passing though me, yes they do
well my friend
want my heart mend
i'm gonna bring it all back to you

brother, sister too
do what you must do
don't trust people you meet
they might promise you
that the river ain't deep
